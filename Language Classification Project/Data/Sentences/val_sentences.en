It is a response that is up to the challenge, even though, according to the World Health Organisation, in 2010 cancer will become the main cause of death in the world, ahead of cardiovascular diseases.
I would like to mention three of them.
The greater emphasis now being placed on governance and the rule of law is intended to reinforce the action in other areas.
The three countries to which the delegation's visit was confined - Eritrea, Djibouti and Ethiopia - have in common poverty and therefore a very low standard of human rights.
The directive does stipulate that Member States must carry out random tests, but I fear that this stipulation is too noncommittal.
Mr President, according to The Times newspaper of London, the recent US Congressional resolution on the Armenian genocide was appallingly timed.
Europe must take a central role, not a back seat, especially if the EU wants to connect with the people of Europe.
Mrs Thyssen worked very methodically in discussions with the Council and the French Presidency and in our Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection.
Bulgaria did not destroy its energy supply, but it affects neighbouring countries, since they stop receiving electricity.
There are still many issues in this field that need to be addressed for EU consumers to feel safe.
To that end, we must encourage car makers to consider even at this stage introducing all these electronic systems into the design of new cars, with a view not just to greater efficiency and ease of driving but also, as a result of all this, to reducing costs and simplifying manufacturing and installation.
Some of the fishermen in my area have been forced to seek a legal review of their situation because under the CFP they are supposed to be guaranteed a living from fishing.
Deficit and surplus are tools, depending on the economic cycle.
And I am glad that we are able to make a step forward regarding this issue.
(Applause)
Another important point, rightly highlighted by Mrs Ivan in her report, is the use of better investigative methods regarding fraud carried out by Member States.
As regards the amendments relating to the recognition of monitoring and control authorities, we believe that, by making the Member States responsible for recognising these authorities, our initial proposal is more in keeping with the principle of subsidiarity.
That would really help our enterprises to compete on the global market.
This refers to Article 1(3)(b), where we have introduced the words 'where justified, it is possible to prescribe the route and the means of transport to be used'.
It is important for us to realise that higher quality requires greater investment in this regard.
The aim is to assess whether resources are being used in the best possible way.
Of course, during this debate, the Members of this House have expressed many points of view, not all of them uniform.
We share Mrs Haug's view that climate and energy policy are not adequately reflected in the budget, and we look forward to the Commission coming up with a clear proposal in the spring as to how this area can be given budgetary support at EU level.
We are dazzled by fabulous cars, miraculous means of communication and the results of innovative, scientific research, but what would life be worth without the beautiful works of art, statues, graphics, textiles or the creative works of music and literature that surround us?
The report does not therefore provide the necessary balance as better protection is required for the rights of debtors.
As the development of the trans-European network may be crucial for Europe's competitiveness and the amendments tabled are merely technical adjustments, I have voted in favour of the report.
For instance, the creation and extension of loans and guarantees to small and medium-sized enterprises was among the measures adopted to improve access to finances.
It is especially important that this body comprising members of EU institutions and Member State employees has full equality in this respect.
Having a family is a great joy, it is a treasure, for men too; why should we not change our views?
(PL) Madam President, Commissioner, listening to today's debate I noted with surprise that the term 'sustainable development' was not used once.
I would urge the Commissioner to take note of the proposals in the motion for a resolution and implement them as a matter of urgency.
The report turns political parties at European level, and the new instrument of political foundations, into effective tools to increase participation by Europe's citizens and boost Europe's democratic legitimacy.
I should like to express my appreciation for their active cooperation and sensible comments.
At the start of the constitutional process the rules were that every country had to ratify or it fell.
As you know, we have the situation in Germany where the Federal Constitutional Court has ruled against a kind of compulsory advertising with a compulsory levy.
We should not therefore exclude ourselves, but rather help ourselves by adopting this more specific instrument today, and tomorrow by adopting the broader package of measures to help victims that will be presented by the Commission, with which I promise to cooperate.
I voted in favour of this resolution on the grounds that the Council's 2009 annual report on the common foreign and security policy (CFSP) - whose transparency I commend - stresses the importance of the European Union continuing to develop its foreign policy objectives, and to promote its values and interests at international level, with the general aim of contributing to peace, to security, to solidarity, to conflict prevention, to the promotion of democracy, to the protection of human rights, to gender equality, to respect for international law, to support for international institutions, to effective multilateralism, to mutual respect between nations, to sustainable development, to free and fair trade, and to the eradication of poverty.
Is this really advisable?
You cannot have more Europe for a lot less money.
The application concerns 821 redundancies made in 70 enterprises involved in printing and the reproduction of recorded media.
8.
I think that the European Parliament is the appropriate forum to speak out about such matters, and to call for the fundamental rights of national minorities to be respected.
I rejoice in that, but I deplore the damage which you are inflicting on 27 former democracies, year by disastrous year.
Written statements (Rule 142)
I am very happy that this initiative, taken by the national libraries of our Member States and developed by the European Commission for so many years, has been highlighted and supported by EU political forces at the highest level.
In this spirit of compromise and also in the Christmas spirit, I feel that we can accommodate these proposals.
This strategy must generate the creation of jobs.
I wanted to ask him whether he should not perhaps come more often, since he would then see that the sessions here are always very attractive.
Thirdly, there could or should be greater scope for self-certification within the industry and, fourthly, we need to ensure that the penalties imposed on farm businesses are commensurate to the scale of the infringement rather than the current inappropriate flat-rate penalties, especially in those cases where infringements were not the fault of the farmer.
Mr President, I welcome this mid-term review of the European Initiative on Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR), commend the work of the rapporteur and welcome the changes allowing tax payments to be made.
We therefore join President Obama and others in the international community who have called for this bill not to be approved and for the review of any laws that would criminalise homosexuality in Uganda.
I can testify to the extreme suffering of the women rape victims and to the impunity of the perpetrators of these atrocities.
Only salaries: no other major item of expenditure, which are strictly under the control of this Chamber and nobody else.
The responsibility for managing the budget lies with the Commission.
Closure of the sitting
I want to repeat my point and stress that, while overall, we have supported this energy and climate change package, I think its adoption in a single reading should be regarded as a one-off.
This is an opportunity which we have to take, and we have to take it now.
First, the goal of the initiators was to turn the Baltic Sea area into one of the most competitive and rapidly developing regions of the EU.
A little closer to our borders, Russia is becoming an increasingly unpredictable and authoritarian neighbour, and the Kremlin is exerting neoimperialistic pressure on the countries which lie just across its borders.
Firstly, because no one knows what will happen next in North Africa and, secondly, because it is clear that the situation between Israel and Palestine is being used as a pretext for global terrorism and tension and, in particular, to ignite tension in the Muslim world.
The light at the end of the tunnel is not protectionism, it is free movement, and the new Single Market Act has the potential to equip Europe to play its global role.
Is Iran's current regime, which has lost its legitimacy and is divided internally, a credible actor in negotiations?
He has not used his wide powers for a long time.
Action programme in the field of lifelong learning (
Many organisations which monitor human rights have presented views, and they have concerns and think that the compromise is inadequate and the human approach insensitive.
But who is aware today that Norway is a party to the Schengen Accords and that Switzerland contributes to the Union's structural policy in the new Member States?
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the Stubb report on the development of the framework for the activities of interest representatives (lobbyists) in the European institutions.
We are talking about sustainability in the social sense.
We think that all parties have a strong interest in reaching a swift agreement.
The Commission also monitors closely the effective implementation of the existing Directives, and on 2 July it adopted a proposal for a directive to ensure protection against discrimination on grounds of age, disability, sexual orientation and religion or belief outside the labour market.
First, the resistance of the Ukrainians to include a Russian expert in the monitoring mission had to be overcome, then an annex added unilaterally by Ukraine to the agreement painfully brokered by our presidency was refused by Russia.
As regards the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia: Mr Wiersma, Mrs Berès and others have mentioned the danger of political instability in this country.
Among the criteria for recognising a European political party's basis in a Member State, the regulation will now require the party to have elected representatives sitting in a regional assembly that has legislative powers.
I come from a State, Greece, which has achieved a very high level of protection for consumer rights.
The Committee on Fisheries believed that Articles 43(2) - referring to the ordinary legislative procedure, or colegislation - and 204 of the TFEU should be adopted as its legal basis, along with the Sole Article of the Protocol (No 34) on Special Arrangements for Greenland.
Once again, together with experts working on religious freedom, such as Christian Solidarity Worldwide, I say that this resolution simply increases the danger for those we want to protect.
The fight cannot be effective without a coherent policy approach focusing on prevention, protection of victims and effective sanctions for traffickers.
On the contrary, if an asylum seeker disappears, the Member State cannot bring the procedure to a negative conclusion.
Madam President, I voted in favour of this resolution and, like Mr Kamall, I have received an increasing number of letters over the last few years about the situation in Zimbabwe.
This is a key point, and I think that the drop in birth rate recorded in the European Union is a serious warning from this point of view.
The working group we have set up in Parliament, called United Europe United History, which already has some 50 Members, will be soliciting just such a condemnation.
(HU) Mr Swoboda, you mentioned that the Czech Republic was reassured at the time of its accession that there was no need for concern about the Beneš Decrees as they were not valid.
We wish to make a plea for the people of Madagascar and to reiterate that it is up to them, and them alone, to decide, without international pressure, who governs them.
This year's work programme will be the last one of this Commission, and it has been prepared under very special and specific circumstances: the follow-up to the war in Georgia, the situation in our neighbourhood, the uncertainties surrounding the Lisbon Treaty after the Irish 'no', the escalation of fuel and commodity prices, the increase in food prices, inflation threatening purchasing power and, last but not least - and you have all mentioned it - the financial crisis affecting banks and other credit institutions.
The European Union Solidarity Fund is principally a source of emergency aid, and I hope that the various Member States will be prepared to invest in a long-term forest policy, fire prevention and protection from floods.
Globalisation has fostered an unprecedented exchange of ideas and contacts between people.
We need to have this political courage, and I do not think that it would hamper a country's ability to welcome incomers if we were to say: 'This is our constitution, these are our rules, these are our human values, and you must comply with them.
It is time for us, too, to take the situation in hand.
Provision must also be made for a relationship or some kind of connection between rural areas, urban and periurban areas.
These qualifications will be recognised on the basis not of certificates awarded by the formal education system of each country, but of certification examinations set by organisations that are controlled by employers.
In order to achieve this, we must have joint working at an international level.
The ultimate goal of everyone in this Chamber is to promote children's interests.
Saying 'no' to vivisection must be an objective of the European Union, since it is a desire of its citizens.
As regards the recent military conflict between the rebel and Chad governmental forces in western Chad, the Council deeply deplores the attacks by the rebels which led to the present fighting.
If the internal market is developed on this basis, we will give you our support and our policy will be moving in the right direction.
Any second lost in administrative and bureaucratic proceedings means huge losses for the international banking system and the financial stock exchanges on all continents, as well as the deterioration of the standard of living for all inhabitants.
Aside from bringing advantages in terms of European flag quality and safety, the proposal will make it possible to improve competition conditions within the Community, and I therefore believe that it should be supported.
We can force people to be happy, but they were in agreement.
There is no historical example, ladies and gentlemen, of a monetary union that has succeeded without robust fiscal union to support it.
I can assure you that there will be no dissenting votes tomorrow from our group and we shall all be voting in favour of it.
Member States might make assurances in speeches that they are ready to pull together, but something quite different is evident where the action taken is concerned.
As far back as 2005, the President of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev, pledged that all the rights of journalists would be respected and that they would be able to count on help in the event of any kind of danger.
I have listened closely, in this respect, to the expectations expressed, according to Mrs De Keyser, within the Committee on Foreign Affairs.
In relation to children it is a good principle, but I would not like it to be a financial barrier to parents who want their children to have a passport, but whose financial means may be limited.
Member of the Commission. - I have already mentioned that the governments, especially the Syrian Government, which the honourable Member referred to, have clearly indicated that they were not in favour of external humanitarian assistance programmes implemented via the international organisations and NGOs.
I welcome the efforts that have been made towards clarifying Union law in order to make it more accessible to all EU citizens.
We in Euskadi - the Basque country - are still suffering from terrorist violence and we are waiting for Euskadi Ta Askatasuna (ETA) to hear the cry of Basque society, which is tired of suffering and is asking for it to renounce violence once and for all.
Why?
The aim of this Commission proposal is to allow the Council to implement the framework agreement signed by the European Hospital and Healthcare Employers' Association and the European Federation of Public Service Unions.
This will clearly be of enormous significance for honourable Members in the coming electoral process and, as I have indicated, we will be sending people out very shortly.
They will control the radio stations, they will control the television networks, but they will not control Sarkozy, that is true.
In Western Europe, 10% of the new infections occurred amongst the 15-to-24 age group, and 25% of those newly infected were female.
(The President cut off the speaker)
We absolutely need full and complete implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact.
Agenda for next part session: see Minutes
I express my deep regret that I have to do this, but unfortunately I have to go to the airport.
I agree with the rapporteur over the need to simplify fishing rules by coming up with a regulation that can implement the recommendations adopted by the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean in a single piece of legislation.
We have signed a readmission agreement with Turkey, which requires the country to do far less than it would have to if it were a member of the European Union.
If we overcome that difficulty, further difficulties lie in store, if only the need to find suitable technologies for storing and transporting hydrogen.
The next item is the one-minute speeches in accordance with Rule 150.
Dublin is not London!
I had serious concerns about full cabotage delivered in one move without any levelling-up of social costs, or indeed running costs, for individual hauliers.
In any country, such a situation sooner or later leads to rioting, instability and often also the spilling of blood.
There, in addition to the activities undertaken in the European Union, work has been started to reduce emissions of methane, one cubic metre of which has a greenhouse effect of the order of 30 cubic metres of CO2 and which depletes the ozone layer.
The existing legislation has brought a number of problems, which we have analysed.
However, we shall have to do more work on the report, because we are process workers and we are only at first reading.
This subject of European identity is a subject for European parliamentary debate, rather than a matter for a head of state or government.
Of course, we are not indifferent to the fate of the al-Kurd family and we want to discuss their fate.
The Commission shares the rapporteur's view that it is essential to continue with our efforts.
The truth is also that the lack of knowledge of the geographical structure of these species and the lack of reliable scientific data meant that TACs and quotas were set for extremely broad management areas and that they were also too restrictive, even going beyond the conditions imposed for species subject to recovery plans.
I could not agree with you more.
This is why I consider it important that in addition to prevention, children should be taught what to do if they receive this type of request or if they are exposed to such influences.
(The sitting was closed at 7.45 p.m.)
Where will the administration be?
Thirdly, we must also ask ourselves whether the rights of air passengers and the rights that are in force pursuant to the existing Package Travel Directive should, in the long term, be transferred into a common document, to eliminate contradictions between components of both legislations.
It will also be the year of the election of a new European Parliament and a new Commission, so what we do in the first six months of 2009 will set the mood for the European elections.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like once again to thank you for allowing me to speak and for the debate and I would like to say that the Commission is fully prepared to cooperate with Parliament in this matter in order to bring about the gradual elimination of this unjust and untenable state of affairs.
The report also recognises the suffering of the people of Belarus and the bravery of the country's democratic forces.
We must therefore concentrate on a thorough analysis and examination of current trends, focusing on using new rules to restrict those technologies and those possibilities which violate the privacy of families and the privacy of children, and which damage the healthy development of the family, and we must apply these rules consistently.
However, this is partly due to policies created here in the European Parliament, so I think the Commissioner should look carefully at the actions we are going to be setting out.
How?
That is essential for this project to succeed in the end.
Expulsions of NGOs from Darfur
We have been discussing it for two hours, but there is one thing that most certainly is not sustainable, and there is clearly exactly the same problem with every President: the fact that we do not know when to ask for the floor in order to have our request granted.
We are independent to deliver price stability to 330 million fellow citizens.
To achieve all that, however, we must show a sense of responsibility at voting time tomorrow; we must necessarily vote responsibly and choose our partners very well.
Reducing the economic disparities between regions and Member States must continue to be the main goal of the cohesion policy.
(CS) Commissioner, there is no doubt that it is necessary to approve the technical changes that are proposed in the annexes to this regulation.
It is now clear that the human and financial resources allocated for the implementation of SIS II will have to be shared between three projects being developed simultaneously: SIS II, SISone4all and the installation, operation and management of a communication infrastructure.
Many cross-border orders - as many as 61% of the orders on the online market - fail to be completed for this reason.
Furthermore, the European Commission must submit as soon as possible a plan for managing the migrant flows, which will take into account the solidarity between Member States and strengthen Frontex's technical and operational capabilities.
Today we are asking for clear contracts, transparency and specific reference to renewable energy sources.
(DA) Mr President, EU transport policy is on the wrong track.
Apart from that, this new case, which highlights to the point of absurdity the narrowness of the criteria now applied in the name of preventing distortions of competition, reinforces the view of my group that, before any final decision is taken on the future European treaty, it is vital to have a thorough, public and wide-ranging debate on the aims of the Union and whether these are consistent with the policies put into operation.
I would ask you to take that up with each of the Member States and ensure that it is implemented, because that sort of protection should extend to officials and to Members of Parliament travelling on the business of Parliament.
We are emphasising the differences between these countries.
Before I conclude, I should like to ask the Council and the Commission when the Solidarity Fund support mechanisms will be made more flexible.
According to a Finnish study, around 32 million EU citizens are exposed to carcinogenic chemicals in their workplace every day.
However, for this reason, Black Sea cooperation is in the interest of the European Union, in the interest of Russia, in the interest of Turkey and in the interest of the remaining countries in this region - most of whom are members of the Eastern Partnership.
These artists should have been able to reclaim their property that they alone were responsible for creating.
In the first place, I believe it is rather premature to talk about a recovery, because, even though there are certain indications, it is still not at all certain that there will be a recovery, and I think we cannot allow ourselves further doubts.
I am not in favour of cutting our jobs in Europe.
(ES) Madam President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs, because their work is going to give European men and women the opportunity to convert their concerns into initiatives in the European Parliament.
These Malthusian policies have been applied to cereals since 1993.
It applies to the results contained in the report by the task force chaired by President Van Rompuy, which the October European Council fully endorsed.
Meanwhile, you have spoken about bringing the guilty parties to justice.
In other words, if there is a group of vessels and that group of vessels represents, say, 100 000 tonnes, and they undertake to decommission 50 000 or 60 000 tonnes, leaving 40 000 tonnes by virtue of which they want to construct new vessels, then for the amount partially decommissioned - for the 50 000 or 60 000 tonnes - they would be given decommissioning aid.
Is it not time that we invested in conflict resolution for troubled states instead of arms sales?
Kamal Abwani, whose cause we were pleading then, is still in jail, although in March the UN investigation team reached the conclusion that it had been an arbitrary arrest.
Thirdly, we need greater coordination between military and humanitarian actors.
Commissioner Verheugen is also right in saying that this phenomenon is not so much a consequence of parallel trade as of altogether different mechanisms which we need to tackle.
Take Libya, for instance: because of the absence of political consensus and proper military assets, a 'coalition of the willing' - a concept we were so adamantly opposed when others have used it before - had to be formed and NATO had to be called in to take command!
We are linking those two issues.
You have not humiliated the Chinese; it is the Chinese who have humiliated you.
The licensing authorities must be able to consider freely the emissions regulations for installations, taking into consideration an installation's age and technical standard, its environmental impact and condition, and the costs of measures for improvement.
I will mention two of the most troublesome, the first being the negative list in the negotiations on trade liberalisation.
Mr President, could I respectfully ask that this debate be extended, because this exchange is far too polite.
The European Union's efforts will remain ineffective as long as we do not stop the destruction of tropical rainforests, plundering Asian, African and American waters, as long as we do not spread more effective education about our joint responsibility for protecting nature against humanity all over the planet, and it will make this report, which I also supported today, just another scrap of paper.
There is a lot for the European Union to do there, especially regarding human rights.
Overdevelopment of the economy, rising unemployment, bitter complaints about high energy prices, for example: all of this leads to a degree of uncertainty, which will of course have an effect on the leading actors in the country.
(Applause)
Just today, at a meeting of the Commission, we approved the communication on derivatives, which will, of course, have to be followed up by concrete legislation.
The measures advocated by the PPE Group and the ALDE Group, namely the swift consolidation of public finances, cuts in public spending, particularly pensions and health care, and the unconditional implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact, will have disastrous long-term consequences on our societies We are heading straight for disaster if we do not establish a tax on financial transactions, as Mr Hoang Ngoc has proposed, and if we do not launch viable recovery measures.
We cannot neglect the difficulties faced by farmers in the newly acceded countries which result from adaptations to meet European standards.
The complete lack of social sensitivity of these monetary policies, with high interest rates and an over-valued euro, is exacerbating social and territorial inequalities, contributing to an increase in poverty and creating more and more problems for micro and small companies, especially in the countries with the weakest economies.
I hope they will be successful in their forthcoming participation in the single currency project and my very best wishes to them in exactly this regard.
Not only is that efficient, it is above all sustainable.
Mr President, in 2004, this European Commission got the green light of the European Parliament only upon the solemn promise to be the champion of fundamental rights.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, the ALDE group does object to this change.
I therefore believe that it is essential for us to do everything we can to speed up the mobilisation of the EGF, bearing in mind the commitment made by the European institutions in order to ensure a rapid and simple process for approving these decisions.
We have got a great diversity of wines, cheeses, meats, olive oil, fruits, vegetables - you name it.
The text you have read to us manages to undermine the entire Barnier proposal.
Are there penalties for divisions or individuals involved in maladministration when it comes to citizens?
But we did not restrict ourselves to approving a joint strategy, we also laid down an action plan and a mechanism for implementing the strategy, and we are now setting up an institution between the European Commission and the African Union, the African Union Commission, to enable them to work together to implement what we have agreed.
Clearly, then, as far as this aid is concerned, we fully agree on the need to increase this credit line, and I am slightly surprised by Mr Becsey's remarks.
At the same time, we are doing what is required to secure the financial stability of the euro area as a whole.
Mr President, I would like to speak about one issue only.
Second, the restoration of basic civil liberties and, obviously, a political dialogue between all parties.
Mr President, in my judgement, the introduction of this beautiful high technology here was intended to save our time and increase our efficiency.
Romania represents the eastern outpost of the European Union and is the state in charge of the management of one of the widest external land borders of the Union.
It should be strongly emphasised that the governing principle that should dominate when it comes to defining the operation of rural areas is equality of opportunity between men and women.
I would say it is about the equal value of all people.
(SK) Madam President, if the European Union is to boost competitiveness and become a world leader in innovation, its creative potential must be adequately secured.
It is in competition between countries and companies to find effective solutions to environmental problems that creativity can flourish, not by bureaucratising our existence.
And I share the view of Anna Ibrisagic that there is now a need to devote much more attention than before to the security and economic situation as well as to the economic development of Kosovo.
Of course we are reminded that the great majority have taken citizenship.
There is already clear evidence that this has helped reduce both energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions.
Furthermore, the motion for a resolution contains absolutely no criticism of the common agricultural policy, which really needs to be reduced before 2013, when the next multiannual financial framework is to be decided.
Let us establish a broad inter-faith dialogue under the auspices of the EU.
Certainly, but let us vote on this and work in the right direction.
We should bear in mind that the Member States, represented by the Council, are part and parcel of this agreement.
(RO) 2008 is the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue.
In the last few days in the European Parliament we have been able to meet bishops who have come here from Iraq, from Mosul and Baghdad, to share their experiences.
With all the congratulations that he is receiving, it seems a little like we are celebrating Mr Bowis today!
I also call for an emergency humanitarian plan for the people, the populations affected by the construction and textile crises.
We want a serious debate about what is referred to as own resources, and this is also important in order for us to eliminate the unhealthy elements in the current financing structure: more rebates, unclear and non-transparent arrangements and so on.
The international community must continue to work so that every person affected by the disaster receives food, clean water, the necessary medical care and shelter.
In order to achieve such ambitious objectives it will be essential to channel more intellectual and financial resources in this direction.
I also agree with the Commission's proposal of a funding source for alternative payment for unused European Social Fund (ESF) resources, in connection with the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF), following Parliament's frequent reminders that the EGF was created separately as a specific instrument, with its own objectives and deadlines, and that it is therefore necessary to identify appropriate budgetary headings for transfers.
The second issue which arises relates to property purchases and transactions between citizens in different Member States.
Is there still much to be done?
The database containing national transposition measures and case-law will be set up this year and will serve as a useful tool in this respect.
We cannot achieve any permanent disposal without looking again at that method.
Commissioner Hahn is not with you, and it would probably have been helpful if he had been.
We did not agree on all the points to begin with.
Fourthly, I would point out that dialogue really does not provide any help and, finally, I note the citizens rightly want more freedom and that they must have our - Europeans' - support in this regard.
Apart from this, the EU is once again applying double standards.
A useful idea in terms of raising patient awareness is the establishment of information and guidance centres to help patients, the healthcare personnel and the entire health sector.
Fifteen years after the outbreak of the wars in Chechnya, there are still 80 000 displaced persons in the region.
Today we, the European Parliament, are supporting a person we have never met, Troy Davis, who is to be executed at the end of this month.
Although patenting rules are not the only factor determining innovation activity, their importance is obvious to all.
Transplantology is one of the most rapidly growing branches of medicine.
Promoting alternative dispute resolution schemes: of course, because this is less time-consuming, more affordable and easier for both consumers and businesses, and also respecting subsidiarity.
We have consumers who cannot choose what kind of energy they are to have and who are hit by increasing energy prices and the effects of greenhouse gases and climate change.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I must admit that when I read the Community strategy for health and safety at work 2007-2012, which was presented last February by the European Commission, I was in many ways disappointed.
The banks persuaded the weak and needy that with loans at 1% they could live the good life, while failing to point out that this 1% was for a limited period only and would soon shoot up.
The EU Member States agreed in 2005 individual minimum aid targets of 0.51% for EU-15 and 0.17% for EU-12, for the new Member States to be reached by 2010 and respectively 0.7% and 0.33% by 2015.
Therefore, my question is very clear: Mr Barnier, as a representative of the Commission, what are you going to place on the table over the coming weeks?
I believe this shows very clearly what people need, namely information about what is actually happening.
Unfortunately, subsequent to such an agreement amendments were tabled on behalf of the PPE-DE and PSE Groups which, if voted for, will mean that the whole compromise package collapses and the matter will go to conciliation, with inevitable further delay in the adoption of measures to protect public health and the environment from continuing contamination by mercury.
(RO) Madam President, I, too, wish to emphasise how important it is to conclude the negotiation of the European Union-Canada economic and trade agreement, thereby strengthening trade and economic links, which are already considerable, and yielding beneficial effects.
What will you be saying to our citizens and also to your commissioners about the things that should be different in this new period?
I should like to conclude by saying that we must balance these elements and do everything to make them clear to our citizens.
(LT) I would like to point out that it is immensely important for an information company to have its material prepared in all the languages of the EU.
There is currently no one representing our interests on this matter.
They were awarded the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought last year by the European Parliament.
Apart from the mitigation of climate change consequences, at the international negotiations on climate change special attention will also be paid to new technologies and the securing of funds.
Once we have received this information, we will examine whether further steps can be taken to alleviate the effects on nature in this area as a whole.
That was something that had a degree of consensus behind it, and therefore we are submitting it to the House for approval or, indeed, rejection.
Order of business
But those calls are quite relevant today and are germane to the condition that we are in.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (DA) Mr President, I wonder if there is anyone in this Chamber who still remembers when the Constitution was changed to the Treaty of Lisbon after its rejection in the Netherlands and France.
I call on this House to oppose this separatist act and infringement of Serbian sovereignty.
The most recent outbreaks of ethnic violence in Mitrovica in early January this year were potentially serious but were contained.
This repression is being stepped up because the regime fears the spread of revolution from the Middle East and North Africa.
All of the events that Parliament is condemning took place in Muslim countries, where particular attention must be paid to the fate of Christians.
This is why sanctions are part of our foreign policy instrument palette, and this is why we do not shirk from applying them in a fairly free and, at times, inappropriate way.
We can only work together on that.
I have requested, via several amendments tabled in the Committee on Regional Development, that this measure be extended to all the Member States of the European Union.
I should like to add two points to what has already been said, which were not mentioned here and which underline the success of the Belgian Presidency.
I believe that the report in front of us is a good one.
This is why the provocation that occurred at the Christmas celebrations last January was particularly blatant and premeditated.
For us, the question arises as to what strategy we can use in response to this.
Mr President, European legislation was set to encourage enterprises to improve their products and obtain higher standards of energy efficiency and environmental compliance.
Only by reminding ourselves of such heinous crimes against humanity can we try to ensure they never happen again.
It is also necessary to ensure, where public money is being invested, that preference is given to the procurement of environmentally-friendly commercial vehicles, for example in the case of public transport or other public services for which vehicles are needed.
Other policies apart from development policy can in fact contribute significantly to development, and this naturally has a direct impact on the effectiveness of our aid.
The European Network of Ombudsmen is an important tool to this end.
Aspects of that conversation are extremely serious because they demonstrate a total lack of respect for the United Nations, disdain for trans-Atlantic relations and disregard for international law.
In Cuba, prosperity and self-initiative are clearly regarded as criticism of the regime.
When the officers of law and order are criminals, who can we protect ourselves from and who will defend the people?
Then we shall start to look at China without the schizophrenia which has led multinational companies, including European ones, to oppose progress in the field of trade union rights, and we shall send a clear message to the Chinese authorities, namely that a major economic and commercial power has obligations on both the domestic and international fronts; this applies before, after and even during the Olympics.
Concerning peace and security, it is true that we do not have too much conflict, but that is because we have an extremely active external policy in order to prevent any conflict as soon as it starts.
We are looking at this problem from various angles, and we are looking for the source of the infection, the identity of the pathogen and the possibility of a cure.
The two documents represent the basic guidelines for all the Member States and their attitude to Cuba, and also for their talks on Cuba with third countries.
Thank goodness, that has now come to an end.
Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, judicial cooperation is to become part of the legislative areas of responsibility of the European Parliament in the very near future.
The hope that the death of Mobutu would finally herald the beginning of progress in Congo has been dashed.
The scheme has not succeeded in reducing emissions and many polluters have even received overly generous allocations and made huge profits from this scheme.
On tackling and identifying hazardous substances in construction products, we managed to broker a compromise ensuring no conflict with existing REACH regulations.

Of special importance in this report are the provisions for women who are breastfeeding at work.
The EP calls on the Commission to submit a cormorant population management plan in several stages to be coordinated at the European level, with the aim of reducing the increasing damage to fish populations, fisheries and aquaculture caused by cormorants.
Taxpayer riots over far bigger scams - bail-outs to corrupt and incompetent banks, propping up the zombie euro and the global warming hoax - are yet to come, but come they will and, unlike Prince Charles and Camilla, their targets will deserve everything they get.
You know very well that is untrue, those of you who applauded so heartily when those lines were spoken.
Two Commissioners will speak.
We cannot do everything; we will need to choose and stick to our decision.
It remains the case that the Commission would actually be much better placed to control the EU's funds itself, rather than via the EIB.

I and a number of other colleagues recently had an opportunity to visit EMSA, which carries out important work crucial to the development of the European Union's maritime transport strategy.
With this package and the investment protection included in it, we have created meaningful incentives, but at the same time have ensured, through the requirements of this regulation, that it is not new markets that are cemented.
Barely six months ago today I, along with Mr Le Foll and a few other colleagues, signed an amendment on this issue and on serious volatility, which aimed to reduce the 1% increase that had been decided on, in particular, for milk production, since we are, in fact, in a period of overproduction.
This text supports the implacable logic of liberal dogmatism.
In particular, the introduction of a financial transaction tax is an issue that we must finally take in hand.

We were concerned about the timetable and scope of application of the future initiatives on procedural rights.
(DE) Mr President, I would like to talk about Mrs Paliadeli's report, specifically because I believe that the European Ombudsman must actually represent the citizens of the European Union.
I would like to stress that the initial proposal was adopted by the Commission one month before the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, so we had the same problem here.
I would still like to ask Mr Duff a question about what he had to say, as he did start talking about the transnational list.
I believe that the European Union must do more in the area of environmental diseases and take more effective action in the interests of the citizen.
That is why factors such as sustainable transport and energy resources have become key elements in other sectoral policies, too.
(Loud applause)
The vote will take place today at the end of the debates.
That is why a broad interpretation of the concept of maladministration is particularly useful.
Without a doubt the very long waiting lists for services.

The European Commission and Parliament are relieved that the Belgian Presidency is over and that no major accidents have happened.
Some of you said the problems are in the euro area.
At the moment, we - that is, the EU per se - are not particularly coherent.
I agree with you.
We must achieve speedy integration through consistent joint implementation and execution of the regulations adopted and the removal of all barriers to the introduction of services onto the market.
I therefore agree on rewording the main objectives and stress the need for a more efficient research policy that cuts out the burden of red tape and provides for greater participation from small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as innovation and funding integration.
Today, we must also mention former Sakharov Prize winners: San Suu Kyi from Burma, Oswaldo Paya and Damas de Blanco.
The narrowed scope and thus the targeted harmonisation will, I am convinced, lead to a more rapid agreement, and I do not see what added value could come forth from continuing and having a second reading.
I would be interested to know whether you are aware of any media reports.
As soon as the Commission submits its proposals concerning the Procedures and Reception Conditions Directives, work can continue on these two laws as well.

There are 8 000 who have United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) identity cards; not very many.
They are on an investigative trip to learn from the European Parliament's experience in this area.
(Applause)
We have other legislative documents, such as the CLP Regulation of 2008 on substances and mixtures and the Globally Harmonised System, which classifies substances and mixtures according to the hazards with which they are associated.
That is enough about the French question, because a decision has been taken by the Commission on that matter, but it is not finished and is still an open procedure.
rapporteur. - (CS) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is facing a number of connected socioeconomic challenges: the emergence of highly competitive countries, the ageing of the population, migration, a fast-changing labour market structure, and booming information and communication technologies.
However, this report includes elements we are unable to support.
Until now, one of the tasks of diplomatic services has been to arbitrate in disputes relating to the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement.
That is the only prospect for a successful peace process in the Middle East.
This freedom, of course, entails responsibility.
Protection of vulnerable workers throughout the European Union should have been secured in the negotiations on the Treaty.
The only way forward is to look at new industries via research, development and innovation.
There are big problems caused by the fragmentation of the European airspace, which causes delays and inefficiency.

(Applause)
I have a question about each.
Voting in favour of Amendment 85 will eliminate this reduction of transport time.
Therefore the June List has chosen to vote against this report.
A particular cause I have for concern is that the planned incinerator would be barely a kilometre from the Hungarian town of Szentgotthárd, which lies in the predominant wind direction, and the Őrség National Park, which is protected under Natura 2000 and which contains the Őrség, recently a winner of the EDEN prize.
There is no doubt that there are at present huge differences in working conditions and payment for temporary workers.
For a long time we have been debating flexicurity.
It seems to me that the spirit of the law is more important than its letter.

I would, however, like to remind you that it is incorrect to say that this issue came to the European Parliament as a result of petitions from citizens.
Nor are the targets agreed in the air quality directive at the level agreed in the Sixth Environment Action Programme.
The economic decisions contained in the Climate and Energy Package, which were made on the grounds of a not-very-credible hypothesis of the cause of climate change, are not only a cynical gibe at common sense, but are also a portent of future economic catastrophe and the upheaval of civilisation.
At the same time, it is the best way we can show young people that we care about the resolution of their problems and can associate them to the idea of a common European home!
Member States may make decisions on invalidity which are binding on another Member State, although complicated by the degree of invalidity, but they may have rules against overlapping of benefits.

The cost of failing, once more, to keep Europe together is far too high.
The same applies to this case as to the previous Danish case.

We must therefore discuss this once again here before second reading.
What we are asking you to do for the first time, in your proposals, is to use clusters when dividing up the responsibilities.
Mr Zaree's execution has brought the number of juvenile executions - as you have said - since the beginning of this year to the very high number of six.
I do not believe that we are doing this when we talk about stress tests, Mr Oettinger.
Instead of giving the principle of food sovereignty its rightful status in the discussions, we have instead given absolute priority to the principle of total free trade.
This means there will have to be interinstitutional talks.
With the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, I urge the Commission to present a new proposal as soon as possible, making the creation of a coherent European policy on effectively fighting the trafficking in human beings one of its main priorities.
We talk about Europe being a Europe of the environment.
I will be very happy to come to Parliament on a regular basis and to brief you on how we are progressing and implementing the Commission's work programme so we can have a debate, not just once a year but on a regular basis, about how we are progressing with the fulfilment of the Commission's work programme.
There is not a single person present, and we should try to correct that for next year.

Producer organisations account today for 40% of the total output of fruit and vegetables.
Given the specific organisation of sport, the dialogue must take account of the different levels of sport.
By failing to provide accounts on the private and social cost of the use of natural resources and on the damage to the environment, conventional accounts may send the wrong progress message to the decision makers and this may put society on the road to non-sustainable growth.
We do not want it in the form of a retreat to an intergovernmental Europe again but as a step forward to a more communal Europe with more participation and more democracy.
- Report: Jorgo Chatzimarkakis
(GA) Mr President, I welcome the Bendtsen report, and I voted for it.

The first matter concerns our policy of cooperation with Turkey in relation to Iran.
Let us take the example of India, where child labour is prohibited.
Despite certain reservations, this resolution accepts the Commission's proposal (amending that regulation) to endorse a standard (IFRS 8) which in turn incorporates a US standard (SFAS 131) into EU law.
I would therefore also like to express my appreciation to everyone whose work contributed to the establishment of a single position here in Parliament and, in particular, to Mrs Françoise Grossetête, with whom I have been sitting almost side by side in this House for a year, and to all co-rapporteurs, without whose cooperation this legislative process could not have succeeded.
These agreements should, however, be based - and I believe it is very important to emphasise this - on the principle of subsidiarity.
Secondly, the evaluation criteria used by the Commission for innovative projects are causing significant problems.
As far as the Peace Process in Mindanao is concerned, the Government appears ready to re-launch talks and we encourage an early resumption of negotiations between the parties and, of course, every discreet mediation that might be there.
draftsman of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the report by my colleague Mrs Pack and I congratulate her on the way in which she has dealt with the topic.
One specific question: I had a call from a manufacturer who works within the European Union asking me if the Commission, Council and Parliament are looking at a 'made in the European Union' label which would enable them to promote the fact that they are producing within the European Union.
The increase in external agencies has been playing an important role in concentrating the technical and administrative capabilities that support decision making in the Commission.
They accept that at the moment, there is no serious threat to the EU industry.
I do wonder, however, if a thermometer is really a suitable metaphor for rating agencies.
Innovation means the successful implementation of ideas in practice.
Member States are therefore not sufficiently motivated to achieve the best possible results in the area of energy efficiency.
Therefore, these discussions are needed as is the resolution.

Was not this an opportunity missed to talk about corruption and bribery at the G8, especially as one of the members, Russia, is 154th out of 178 and many of our own Member States show poorly on the Transparency International index?
Hundreds of thousands of citizens will not have the right to vote or stand as candidates, and at least 25% of MPs will be from the military.

We believe that a priority action must target the European industrial base, particularly the 'backbone' industries such as the automotive sector which, as you know, is very seriously affected by the economic slowdown.
As the rapporteur mentions, the proposal in question aims to enable Union manufacturers to sell tractors, to overcome the time of economic crisis currently being experienced, to find new resources for research and to respect European legislation's limits as regards environmental protection, whilst simultaneously replacing the most obsolete tractors with new tractors that have less polluting engines.
It is an important Presidency.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, we all know that it is downright absurd that two private US firms and one from the UK should be making decisions about the bankruptcies of EU Member States.
That is short-sighted.

Although this wording waters down a bit the initial proposal by the EPP shadow (Handzlik, Poland) according to which there has been no problem at all, this still tends to ignore the uncertainties created by the directive regarding, in particular, the social services to be included or excluded in its scope.
The second topic is the admissibility of the initiative.
If we promoted measures to clean up our forests - and, for instance, the product of such measures could be used to produce energy through biomass power plants duly designed for the purpose - if we acted in that way, we would certainly be helping the environment by protecting it and, at the same time, we would be creating jobs which, at the current moment, is another of Europe's aims.
We must not forget that 99% of European businesses are small and medium-sized enterprises.
You talk about opening up to the world market.
Russia must stop using situations of this kind in a way which is not in keeping with international procedures and refrain from creating new spheres of influence.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the decision to use the few remaining funds in the Recovery Plan started in 2009 in a different way and to take advantage of this opportunity to introduce a new principle with the setting up of an ad hoc fund is far-sighted and in line with what we have been saying for some time in this Chamber but have never been able to act on.
But that does not mean a vote of confidence in the whole College of Commissioners.
What is most important, however, is to undertake steps aimed at improving the situation on food markets, not just by ad hoc activities, but actions that will lead to long-term stability.
We cannot allow to otherwise ignore the fact that prevention of this phenomenon is part of the battle against it: to educate children and parents how to avoid coming into contact with this phenomenon and with the people involved in it; to limit all types of advertising which provoke open and aggressive sexuality; that there is more concern for children in various institutions, who often become victims of sexual violence; integrating efforts for averting child trafficking - one of the main reasons for trafficking is namely sexual exploitation; and to form networks consisting of non-government and government structures as a countermeasure.
And naturally, a higher degree of solidarity and better coordination should be expected.
The 1988 directive may have come up to expectations and safeguarded a high level of safety in toys for twenty years, but it urgently needs to be revised and updated, given that there are now new types of toys and new materials on the market and factories established in countries outside the European Union.
These deaths could be prevented.
in writing. - I support the compromise of the Breyer Report on the placing of plant protection products on the market because it will provide for greater stability and security for farmers and food producers.
I voted in favour of this report because it makes auctioning the general allocation principle, limits the amount of CDM/JI project credits that an installation can purchase to offset its emissions and still protects companies against carbon leakage.

Directive 87/217/EEC on the prevention and reduction of environmental pollution by asbestos provides for measures to control asbestos emissions during certain demolition, decontamination and disposal operations in order to ensure that those activities do not cause pollution by asbestos fibres or dust.
The European Council also faced the possibility that, in the event of failure of the international negotiations, it should assist the energy-intensive sectors in the European Union, because their relocation to countries with lower environmental standards would risk losing jobs in the European Union, at the same time increasing greenhouse gases in general.
All too often this has led to unacceptable abuses in relation to working conditions, and to human rights violations and environmental damage.

In this context, creating quality partnerships in higher education and business is of the utmost importance.
The objective of the EU Eastern Partnership initiative being pursued should be the promotion of common European values, with an emphasis on the functioning of democratic institutions and respect for human rights and freedoms.
I should like to make a proposal regarding the amendments dealing with the legal base: the Presidency must decide on the admissibility of these amendments, specifically, Amendments 159, 119, 116 and 125, but the decision naturally has to depend on the final configuration of the directive, which will be modified in the course of voting.
If Europe reduced its agricultural output, the rise in food imports would contribute significantly to the global rise in food prices.

These are the points that we have fought for in this House and would like to see voted through.
I would like to thank the European Commission which, in the end, negotiated a tight follow-up with us, also under pressure from a tough-talking rapporteur from this committee.
The margins of the current Multiannual Financial Framework are very narrow, even suffocating I would say, and they leave no room for manoeuvre in coming years; for example, on the basis of the margins under Titles 1a and 4, unforeseen requirements cannot be met.

in writing. - (FR) I voted for this text, which requires the Member States to participate in collecting the necessary data to put together effective energy statistics.

Here, the matter of income distribution is extremely important, because we cannot make the poor people in Europe pay the bill either.
It is for the sake of young men like Mamuth, who are entitled to a new life and do not deserve to be shunted back and forth across borders again, that I am pleased that this House is now going to change that situation and that rapporteur Claude Moraes has managed to take this first step in our asylum packages.
I was gratified that Parliament dealt with this report expeditiously and that Mr Martínez Martínez's report, adopted by plenary in May 2009 without a single vote against, reflected entirely the concerns I had raised.
Therefore, I hope that the early elections called for June 2011 will contribute to resolving the situation.
We are also very involved in cross-border care and the protection of patients' rights in Europe, also under the watchful eye of rapporteur Mr Bowis, and I hope and expect that we will achieve a positive result in that area too.
Iran, in particular, the case of Nasrin Sotoudeh (
This will be a symbolic journey through sites that were previously symbols of closure and that will, from 21 December, be symbols of the freedom that is the air and oxygen breathing life and happiness into Europe.
in writing. - The Commission proposes to mobilise the European Union Solidarity Fund in favour of Portugal and France under point 26 of the interinstitutional agreement of 17 May 2006 on budgetary discipline and sound financial management (IIA).
Madam President, my colleagues Mr Bové and Mr Belder sketched the problem and the political reality, but there is a new trend in farming.
Recovery will not come from outside, if the body, or the state, does not take up the fight.
(Applause)
I believe that the report reflects these views and I voted in favour.
The point which the Committee on Budgets is insisting on and which we do not agree with is resources being cut from other policies so that the EUR 190 million in question is allocated for the next three years.
During the past decade, the average life expectancy in Zimbabwe has fallen from 60 years for both sexes to 37 years for men and 34 for women.
(RO) Mr President, I voted for this motion for a resolution.
(RO) I, too, wish to extend my sympathy regarding the events which have taken place and would like to make the following comments.
On this point, therefore, we are not talking simply of wishes but of concrete proposals.
The instruments associated with the Green Paper present a series of measures without offering systemic solutions.
If this latest study by the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment shows that the revised Toys Directive does not provide sufficient protection from carcinogenic softening agents, we will have to take action.
This is a legal regularisation of something that has been happening de facto for some time: the pushing of the powers that we regard as definitive of statehood from national to Brussels level.
The Greek public deficit was 12.7% of GDP in 2009, well above the 3% ceiling permitted under the Stability Pact for countries in the eurozone.
In this context, your commitment here in Parliament - and I thank the rapporteur once again - and your cooperation with the Afghan Parliament, the Wolesi Jirga, are invaluable.
(FR) Madam President, I wish to reply to Mr Rübig and Mrs Doyle, as these are questions which have already caught my attention.
The report also implicitly admits the failure of the financial markets to channel savings into investments that will create wealth.
A motion for a resolution to close this debate has been tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
President-in-Office of the Council. - I can only reiterate the principles and the values that the European Union stands for and that the Council, of course, defends.
I agree that biodiversity conservation issues are raised only intermittently in public debate.
They often pose a safety risk, and the losses they incur do not only affect SMEs.
These proposals will be examined by the Council and this House within the framework of the regulation procedure with which you are familiar.
(NL) Mr President, I voted in favour of the Auken report, as I believe that all citizens in Europe have the right to proper application of all legislation and that the private property of each and every citizen in the European Union must be safeguarded by the governments of all Member States.
Mr President, this Brok report is positive proof of the emergence of a single European Union superstate.
Complementary, of course, to Doha, it will drive Europe's recovery and growth and the European Parliament will be instrumental in determining the future of global trade policy.
So, yes, it was a good day for Europe, and the day on which this treaty is finally ratified will be an even better day.
In 2009, the euro represented around 30% of the stock of international debt securities and the stock of global foreign exchange reserves.
The text from the Committee on the Environment is, however, acceptable.
(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in the book by Albert Camus, the plague is announced futilely by a rat who comes and dies at our feet.
How much of this aid has actually arrived in the field?
On the other hand, and you explained this in your last remark, the extent to which economic and social development is needed is clear, because this is also an important yardstick for political stability.
If it did happen, it would revolve around Tibet and not Burma, which is the topic of debate at this moment.
in writing. - (EL) The PASOK Group supports, inter alia, the content of Amendment 50, in order to ensure that the long-term objective of 95 grams of CO2/km will be legally binding from 2020.
I must say that this is an important issue that arises again and again: 20% for education, health, water, etc.
I want to point out that the new countries, too, have quality education and research institutions, including universities, which should be systematically encouraged to strive for the mark of excellence.
We are also busy preparing a proposal that will allow changes to the regulation establishing the Frontex agency and its working methods.
The Commission will propose a legislative framework for achieving the Community target of 120 g/km by 2012.
Member of the Commission. - When the CAP reform was agreed among the Ministers in the Council in 2003, it was the mandate that was given to the trade and agricultural commissioners.
What do we want from this agreement?
It makes achieving the Lisbon objectives difficult.
We also need to maximise the control measures in order to prevent airlines from using circumstances like these to make gratuitous or excessive adjustments to their workforce.
However, there is a serious problem: there is no longer a reasonable balance between Europe's employees and Europe's employers.
Kolejnym punktem porządku jest głosowanie.
It therefore seems to me to be very important that in paragraph 10, it is proposed that the arrangements for the transmission of documents, among other things, need to be clarified explicitly.
One thing I missed hearing in today's speech was any reference to our largest European neighbour, Ukraine.
Regarding the financial perspectives, I have already made a commitment to putting forward the proposal for a specific kind of Eurobond - euro project Eurobonds - and, even though I have already heard some negative comments from some capitals, I am still hopeful that this will come into being.
EUR 142 650 billion - that is the budget for the financial year 2011, adopted by the European Parliament at midday today.
At the same time, we call on them to abide by the rules of a democratic state and to ensure respect for human rights, which are obligations they assumed as part of the Eastern Partnership.
You will understand that I cannot pre-empt that - it will be for the new Commission to decide.
The States will have to commit themselves in Copenhagen!
I realise that it is difficult and I realise that the rules can be very complicated.
We do therefore have to ask ourselves questions.
Banking institutions from the Republic of Ireland also have a considerable stake in Northern Ireland.
It is interesting that after the failure of the stress test the press was flooded by false success reports even last year - obviously this was also due to the machinations of the European Commission.
I watched in close-up -
To that end we support the Commission in its efforts to use the Integrated Guidelines to facilitate fundamental reforms to underpin a new framework of confidence to enable the difficulties we are facing to be overcome.
Secondly, from now on, insurers cannot refuse to issue insurance because someone has a genetic disorder or disability.
Copenhagen is 12 months away.
I fully support the report's recognition of the fact that there are mortgage obligations and other types of securities issued that are, in fact, equally as liquid and secure as government bonds.
Let us not fool ourselves.
We make a concerted effort every year to build on that consensus, so that the international community can send a firm and united message.
Let me also say that the Commission, in its function as observer within the management system in the committees in the Member States, is also looking at and actively participating in the assessment of the allocation of funds in the areas important to ethnic minorities, so we have different sorts of information.
The adoption of common standards, through a European ITS Committee, applies to four specific areas: firstly, optimal use of road, traffic and travel data, secondly, continuity of ITS services on transport corridors and in conurbations, thirdly, road safety and security and, fourthly, integration of the vehicle into the transport infrastructure.
Moreover, the continuous harassment of motorists and the motor car by eco-citizens, governments and certain local councillors is scarcely compatible with the defence and promotion of our automotive industries.
We had the possibility to decide on a climate package by codecision, by qualified majority voting.
So, for people like that, this legislation will be extremely important, and we look forward to its rapid implementation.
This is why I expect that we know what we will do with the model of the social market economy.
The existing rules are improved and supplemented by two reports, one by Mr Savary and one by Mr Fernandes.
Do you see any opportunity for the use of best practice and benchmarking in order, quite simply, to help improve the situation here?
That will help us to build a coherent approach that can serve as a model for elsewhere.
Now my opinion has become official: the EU's own monitoring system has not - as I suspected - turned out to be a placebo, a sedative for critics, within the space of a few years, but rather after just a few months.
However, there is only one Internet service provider who has a monopoly of broadband in the town and, although it is expanding, the connection is extremely slow and simply not conducive to running a business.
Deregulating and liberalising international trade and directing it towards competitive rather than complementarity logic (which should guide it), means promoting the interests of importers and distributors, but at the same time condemning thousands of producers to ruination and forcing them to abandon their livelihoods, increasing food deficits and jeopardising the basic criteria for food and environmental security and quality.
Today, all EU Member States have ratified. There are five partner countries which still have to ratify.
My last point regards the comprehensive portal on diseases, which was mentioned by Mrs Weisgerber.
These measures were slow in coming, even though milk producers have been talking about their problems since last spring.
The report points out, however, that it is important to respond both to the challenges and the opportunities now.
So we have a lot of work still to do.
I therefore urge the Commission to present at the earliest possible opportunity an impact assessment of the effects of the banana trade agreements on banana-producing developing countries and the European outermost regions until 2020, so that we can appraise these countries' difficulties and act accordingly and, if necessary, adjust and strengthen the Programme of Options Specifically Relating to Remoteness and Insularity (POSEI).
The European systems that are in place - Mrs Roth-Behrendt was quite right - do work.
Once again, I would like to thank Parliament and its rapporteur for this very supportive report and its very important recommendations.
We must assume today that the public finances of numerous Member States are not sustainable and have the courage to remedy that.
in writing. - (RO) The Romanian Members of the European Parliament from the Group of European Socialists abstained from voting on the report regarding the agreements between the EC and Georgia, Lebanon, Maldives, Moldova, Singapore and Uruguay on certain aspects of the air services due to the reference, in the text of the Agreement with the Republic of Moldova, to the Moldavian language in the phrase "Concluded in Luxembourg in two counterparts in the Bulgarian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Maltese, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Slovakian, Slovenian, Spanish and Swedish and in the Moldavian language”.
(ES) Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his patience in listening to and noting the various requirements that reflect the existing diversity of the airport systems in Europe.
This is extremely important.
It is somewhat regrettable that not all EU countries are equally active in transferring their cultural heritage to virtual space.
Another issue that concerns us in this difficult context is the decline in the competitiveness of our farmers who, unlike their competitors, face high production costs.
Therefore, the fact that the opportunity has been taken to make a few corrections, also with reference to other aspects, within the ambit of a wider reform of the Rules of Procedure under the Treaty of Lisbon cannot, in my view, be seen as unacceptable - all the more so since quite a few amendments would serve to reflect the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon in the Rules of Procedure, sometimes through rules that are reproduced technically and materially in them, but much more often through reference to the spirit of the treaty.
Poverty can affect anyone.
It is an important step, because it is a step forward for the people.
Thank you for all your work.
Unfortunately, there is also a direct danger of a war against disobedient Georgia.
My final point is about Pandora's box and Kosovo.
First of all, I am told that if there is no agreement, there will be no growth.
We therefore wish to withdraw our amendment.
As for the environment and climate change, there are positive elements in the target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, more so than in the United States and other countries.
Likewise, the possibility for EU citizens to carry their pets with them, without being subjected to specific national regulations and standards, is important, as it can significantly reduce their travel efforts and costs.
Georgia, led by Saakashvili, is a committed partner to the EU, and despite numerous problems it is showing significant progress in the areas of reform and economic growth.
Hence the need to consider each country individually.
The reason for that is the depth of the analysis that had to go into the proposal, to guarantee that it is a really effective instrument to address the severe problems the sector is facing.
Latvia's particular contribution to the eastern dimension is the mutual trust demonstrated by our bilateral relations, which are rooted in a shared period in history, and the expertise born out of that trust.
We must adapt the seas and their resources and coordinate actions, therefore the integrated maritime policy is important as all areas of maritime policy will be linked: maritime transport, fishing, aquaculture, energy, safety at sea, protection of the maritime environment and scientific research as well as tourism.
Our amendment reads as follows, therefore - I shall read it out in English, as we have been working in English, so as to get all our fellow Members on board as quickly as possible:
Cattle feed accounts for 60-80% of their costs, and their revenues are plummeting: they survive on an average of EUR 700 per month.
A happy ending for the hostages in these cases must not be greeted with delight as the ship owners and countries affected pay a high price for it.
Adding to that, there are various measures that we have introduced in order to regain sustainable fishing, and that means that the fisher cannot try to improve his performance by catching more, because if he catches more, he creates further pressures on fish stocks which would then be, in the long term, counterproductive.
We have just had further proof of this in the astonishing negation of the French people's vote in the 2005 referendum, aided and abetted by our lacklustre leader President Sarkozy.
The goal is to establish a free trade zone with free trade agreements and gradually to abolish visa requirements.
Iran is naturally an important player in the Middle East.
It is high time that the Council acknowledged once and for all the democratic will expressed here by the majority of MEPs.
The role of the national parliaments will be strengthened under the new Treaty currently under discussion within the Intergovernmental Conference.
I asked then and I am still asking today: how can Romanian and Bulgarian farmers reconcile the 'takeoff' procedure with the 'soft landing' procedure?
The spillage from the New Flame has only amounted to 24 tonnes to date, compared with more than 70 000 tonnes from the Prestige.
For this reason, I consider it to be important to implement practices such as experience exchanges between the administrations of European cities, urban optimisation databases at European level, as well as to encourage citizens to change the way in which they approach the issue of personal transportation in the urban environment.
Those are typical examples of a lack of trust in one another's legal systems.
Fourthly, we need to have clear support for the energy efficiency policy.
We stand by that and I ask them: please do not abuse the freedoms we hold dear.
It is central banks and finance ministers who control the purse strings.
Regardless of the variety of opinions on the individual key issues in the directive and bearing in mind that it is still being considered at second reading, I wish to confidently state that the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe concurs with the compromise decision reached so that this legislation can be introduced as quickly as possible by Member States.
on behalf of the PPE Group. - (PT) I take the floor in this Chamber today with my voice weighed down with the distress of someone who personally experienced and witnessed the tragedy that struck Madeira last Saturday.
There is also another fact.
We are here to convey the anxiety, the cry for survival of the creative forces of the European countryside, and that cry for survival from the people in the European countryside is for us a standing instruction to act.
There is a difference between the electricity market and the gas market.
President Karzai himself clearly says that the coalition forces are not winning the fight against the Taliban and adds - very fittingly I would say - that winning the war against terrorism will be possible only if some of the Afghan Government's partners stop pursuing their own (different) interests.
He considered it the most important enemy of the state after the various foes he did battle with on his borders.
If we now exchange the Treaty of Nice for the Treaty of Lisbon, and replace Sweden with the Czech Republic, those articles look exactly the same.
It is thus necessary to act so that these new interest representatives are clearly identified and so that rules on their activities are laid down and observed.
Commissioner, I do not doubt for one minute your commitment to this area.
This is a result of the fact that the governments of developing countries do not spend enough on health.
In that context I welcome the firm legislative framework.
Each and every one of them is essential.
Integration and supervision of the financial markets - that is another area of considerations that your rapporteurs have covered in their report.
Report: Rosa Miguélez Ramos
If the latter is to be credible and efficient, it must be strengthened by the introduction of yearly fines for non-compliance with recommendations or the obligation to draw up a sufficient corrective action plan.
In this way, the EU must act as an area of solidarity, combining this assistance to Bosnia with the aforementioned appropriate aspects.
Further, as an Irish MEP and voter, it is interesting to note that this report and the amendments link the Treaty of Lisbon and the Charter of Fundamental Rights with the legislation of abortion in the EU.
I would, however, draw my fellow Members' attention to the cross-border dimension of this policy.
I am also concerned by the lack of guarantees regarding the allocation of EU financial assistance aimed at facilitating the decommissioning process.
I therefore welcome the new rules to improve the Ecolabel and to make it better known.
Quite simply, they are wrong.
This will happen this year in Poznań and next year in Copenhagen.
We need a strong EU strategy to ensure that this fundamental right is upheld and that workers throughout the EU are adequately protected.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, in the European Union we have recently seen a significant rise in the price of basic foodstuffs, particularly in the new Member States.
As regards Romania, I should point out that there is no risk of an earthquake jeopardising the operation of the Cernavodă nuclear power plant.
member of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, honourable members, I would first of all like to congratulate Mrs Gomez for her excellent work on this sensitive and difficult, even controversial, subject.
Objections against the internalisation of external costs are raised on the grounds that it will affect competitiveness.
(The President cut off the speaker)
We can wish for many things, but the important thing is that we enable our citizens to live a life of dignity and prosperity in which they can enjoy education and the other services provided by society.
For a long time Europe and the United States have been allies vital to prosperity, development and globalisation.
Thank you for your attention.
Let us see if they do it.
Ladies and gentlemen - and this is something to which the ALDE Group attaches a great deal of importance - we now need to take the appropriate measures to also make the Danube Strategy a regional policy priority in the new funding period.
It should continue to take the initiative even if, instead of ground-breaking changes, climate politics will now be characterised by small, incremental steps.
I am convinced that the relaunch of the Single Market will rely on the equal participation and close cooperation of all the EU institutions.
We therefore need to be more political, and we also need to reflect the multiannual challenge of initiatives of the scale we intend.
In fact, China's policy towards these ethnic minorities was liberal in the 1980s but it has gradually become tougher, and the Chinese authorities seized upon 11 September 2001 in order to publicise their fight against - and note how they are all merged - terrorism, separatism and religious extremism.
Currently, EU contributions account for a third of Mauritania's national budget.
I believe that Europe's regions must be given far more financial support to help implement the measures for preventing these disasters.
This has not been fully achieved, and it may be necessary to think of further, more specific solutions.
Both in the multi-annual programme on consumer protection and in the resolution and the debate further to the withdrawal from the market of unsafe, mainly Chinese toys, we have made passionate pleas for the protection of the smallest and most vulnerable consumers, namely children, to be placed high on the agenda.
On the social level it can achieve greater involvement of people from different backgrounds and social classes.
With regard to environmental policy, in 2008, we were one of the first institutions to receive EMAS certification - we can be very proud of that.
Currently, many would claim that the eurozone problem is one which should be solved by eurozone members.
(PL) Madam President, it is essential that adults take more responsibility for the conditions faced by children and the opportunities they have in life.
This intransigence is blocking a series of legislative processes, and this is doing nothing to benefit the EU.
Therefore, beyond rhetoric, how can we respond to the tragedy in this region?
This attempt at destabilisation will fail in Europe, as it is failing in France, where the whole Muslim community naturally condemned these barbaric acts immediately.
Madam President, thank you to Peter Liese, Matthias Groote and the other shadow rapporteurs for getting us what I consider to be a good agreement.
The two reports on which you will vote today demonstrate that, when MEPs, Ministers of Finance and Commissioners think ahead of the curve and provide political leadership, a speedy and effective response to the challenges we face is possible.
We are not obliged to make our Memorandum to the Irish Government open to the public.
It is necessary to clarify the powers and duties of the competent authorities responsible for implementing this directive and to strengthen the mechanisms needed to ensure effective cross-border cooperation in the field of monitoring.
The Government in the United States of America, that fatherland of predatory capitalism, has privatised the profits from speculation and is now socialising the biggest losses to the trash bank through speculation in the history of its economy.
There have been both the difficulties of the new members implementing our ever increasing policies and acquis and our difficulties in adjusting to our own success in the form of new members, but when we look back, it is easy to see that periods of enlargement have been periods in which we have also deepened our cooperation.
This war and occupation have caused hundreds of thousands of deaths; this war and occupation were, and still are, illegal, entered into in complete violation of international law, unilaterally and against the wishes of the majority of Member States, the United Nations and international public opinion.
It also rejects protectionism.
However, this aim should be achieved by measures that do not interfere with the development of industry in the European Union or the trade in medicinal products.
Therefore, I would also like to thank you sincerely for what you have told us.
Biogas can also contribute to the achievement of the 10% biofuel target.
Turkey continues to maintain the Greek Orthodox Monastery at Halki closed for no apparent reason, and to deny its ancient Syriac Christians full community rights.
Another crucial element is dealt with in this report: that of product safety from a global perspective.
The Treaty of Lisbon said that income had to be provided from our own resources.
However, I believe that the Parliament needs to review our entire working methods and staffing with a view to improving our effectiveness and efficiency.
- Madam President, there is no dispute about the fact that the oil apparently came from Northern Ireland.
Cantonese and Shanghainese are also to be replaced by Mandarin throughout the education system and even on the radio, this despite the fact that the government claims that Mandarin is only spoken by half of the Chinese population.
This is probably even more important than how much money we actually have or can inject.
We were expressing these fears a long time ago, before the hunger riots or the financial crisis.
With regard to the Commission's management, we welcome the substantial increase in the execution of payments and we hope that this trend will continue in 2007, although we know that this year is going to be the start of a new programming period and our experience shows us that it is more difficult to fulfil this goal and that there is a degree of delay.
What will be the priorities and the basic messages of the Community's unified communications policy for the year ahead, in particular during the run-up to elections?
These measures will benefit citizens who live in large towns and cities, who now account for the majority of Europe's population.
But there are some key questions left open.
We are entering the era of sustainable growth, this third industrial revolution which is a great asset for research, innovation, employment and competitiveness in our businesses.
May I say that these are two different issues.
There needs to be a differentiation between micro, small and medium-sized businesses.
We call on the government there to respond positively to the recommendations of the UN's panel of experts, which highlighted war crimes and crimes against humanity on the parts of both the Sinhalese and the LTTE.
This should, in particular, cover issues such as the transfer of ownership in enterprises (particularly in the case of the illness or retirement of the owner) and for harmonised time limits for the payment of transactions (to avoid 'credit crunches').
Today he has stated clearly that he is doing what he can, in very difficult circumstances.
Citizens are looking with a negative eye on developments, which do not promise to be pleasing and satisfactory.
Moreover, we cannot propose to fingerprint six-year olds without, for instance, first being able to produce a broadly-based independent study on the use of fingerprints of children of that age and without knowing how long such children's fingerprints can be kept in the first place.
The dual-track approach and the preparation of smart targeted sanctions by the UN Security Council are warranted.
We ask them to put a stop to tax evasion and yet, at the same time, we are not offering them any help.
The transaction for which we created the basis in the Budget Committee in the first reading, is called a 'minor revision'.
Public opinion in Romania was recently drawn by the case of three women belonging to the same family, daughter, mother, grandmother, who were imprisoned simultaneously to serve a sentence for a minor offence.
Parliament sees that the budget is small in relation to these objectives, but it is also aware that Member States are not making full use even of the current budgetary framework.
Apart from that, I am pleased that the passage calling for the pay-as-you-go pension system to be replaced with a capital-funded system was nevertheless rejected by the European Parliament.
This communication was an input to the latest review of the Copenhagen Process, and the Bruges Communiqué has now, of course, become the European agenda par excellence for vocational training for the years 2011-2020.
(FR) Mr President, the excellent report by our fellow Member - whom I congratulate - on which we are going to vote today, is important because the European animal feed sector is one of our main agricultural sectors, both in terms of production, since it accounts for half of the agricultural production within the European Union - 120 million tonnes - and of turnover - around EUR 50 billion.
The rapporteur admits that the agreement will facilitate the importing of timber originating in Cameroon to the EU and that this may result in conflicts with the EU's objective of combating climate change.
Even if he is right, our whole plan to fight climate change is a response to the serious economic crisis we are now experiencing.
We need a more active labour market policy and one which covers many areas.
I would like to end with a few words as a member of a delegation that opposed the launch of enhanced cooperation on the unitary Community patent and to say that we opposed it, because we believe that the enhanced cooperation instrument may directly affect the internal market, territorial cohesion and the right of citizens of all Member States to have maximum legal security.
For these reasons, I think it would be more useful and worthwhile to set up a privileged commercial partnership, instead of insisting on the long and winding road to accession.
The economic crisis that has afflicted Europe in recent years must be overcome, and we can only hope to revitalise our economy by supporting these companies.
You may recall that for several months I sat as a non-attached Member and, if I may say so, my political views are so divergent from yours that it merely proves the point that the non-attached section is not a group, and never can be.
The view expressed today concerns the 2 834 redundancies, all targeted for assistance from the Fund, in the primary enterprise General Motors Belgium and four of its suppliers operating in the motor vehicle sector.
I would like to focus on just a couple of points.
This type of dedication for the common good, for the people, should be what we expect from the new Kyrgyz ruling class, which is not, in point of fact, all that new.
Documents received: see Minutes
Success, however, is not only the responsibility of the Commission.
As a result, and given the plans for future facilities in Europe, it is essential to lay down a Community framework for nuclear safety.
Two events were instrumental in reversing the emerging trend.
We are encouraged by the prospect of reform in the common agricultural and fisheries policies, but concerned this may result in more bureaucracy rather than a fair solution for our farmers and fishermen.
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President, the Commission proposal for a Global Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Fund (GEEREF) is, of course, welcome.
The consumer must be king.
I spoke to President Uribe last Thursday and congratulated his government and army and the Colombian people on this successful operation.
The following are, therefore, necessary:
The economic crisis was used as a lever to force people to vote 'yes'.
By the way, in the United States they are having the same discussion, because in the Liebermann-Warner bill for the introduction of an emissions trading system in the United States they have a similar provision.
The possible solutions vary between Member States, regions and communities.
For that reason, we, and governments in particular, cannot afford to throw a spanner in the works of these businesses.
At present, whilst tax demands continue to be intensified in every one of the Member States, mobility is almost impossible.
in writing. - (SV) The internal market is the EU's greatest contribution to democracy and prosperity in Europe.
Madam President, Commissioner, I should like to thank and congratulate you and Mr Saryusz-Wolski for your current work and achievements.
We are opposed to that idea.
Secondly though, given the debate we have just had, in the context of the current global financial crisis, it sets a very positive example.
It is vital to ensure that the Euro-Mediterranean integration process is restored as a political priority of the EU, since the success of this process and of the free trade area could contribute to peace, prosperity and security throughout the region.
Secondly, it seems important to me that the Observatory brings together both EU Member States and European states outside the Community, offering an important cohesion factor at the level of all European countries.
No doubt they would be able to solve most of their problems by working together.
As the current financial and economic crisis and the resulting lower budgetary income are having a particularly adverse effect on the finances of local and regional authorities, it should be ensured that the difficult budgetary situation of those authorities does not hinder them from being able to access the funding.
(Applause)
What at this stage are the directions the debates are taking?
We say it is necessary to have more children born.
In Europe, the economic growth in the 50s and 60s has led to the expansion of the horizontal city, whose population has left the city centre in favour of suburbia.
However, in a crisis such as the one we are going through, I believe that we must not go overboard with conditions.
Today, more than ever, it is more trade that we need, not less.
Madam President, the adoption of the Rome Statute and the establishment of the International Criminal Court (ICC) is a success story.
They are, for the most part, European citizens, and the EU must establish a strategy for integrating them.
My reasons are that the fight against intolerance, discrimination and, in this case, also homophobia and the death penalty, requires us to be very firm and call upon the Commission and the Council to be firm too.
If the southern part secedes, it will be necessary to show support for as peaceful a transition as possible.
In order to emphasise the international dimension of migration, the issue of cooperation with the countries of origin and transit within the framework of the global approach to migration and development should have its starting point in the Stockholm Programme.
We voted on the resolution on media law in Hungary in view of this, taking its positive and negative aspects into account.
At the same time, we need to be aware of the future risks which we are exposed to.
Mr President, let me put this straight.
We also have to compare in what kind of environment in Europe we are operating.
I have asked my services to provide me with an analysis and for the total effort-sharing and ETS the efforts within the European Union will be about 60%; 41% could be abroad, in developing countries.
It is my belief that our quality system can be a good ambassador for our agri-food model, and even for our common agricultural policy.
However, there are still several issues awaiting future clarification from a legal perspective.
This should all happen within the framework of a revitalised Euro-Mediterranean dialogue.
Therefore, the united voice of 58% of Europe's citizens is making itself heard again.
Fortunately, we have now sorted out a number of missing links, although Parliament would have liked to go further on a number of points.
It does a real job in connecting with our citizens in this area.
This is a common threat requiring a global response - one that provides the means, resources and specialist knowledge to deal effectively with major crisis situations that a Member State would have difficulty tackling alone.
The Union has a fundamental role in the harmonisation of national social security systems and the transferability of supplementary pension rights.
Thank you on behalf of the ALDE Group.
Instead of all this, we must, as a matter of urgency, reverse these migratory flows, reinstate the internal borders, implement a real family-focused policy to increase the European population, and impose national and European preference in all areas.
Thirdly, we are living through an economic crisis, and as a result we have a responsibility to our citizens.
It is an irrelevant report. So: all the assets are in all the stock exchanges in New York, London, Tokyo, Frankfurt, etc.
What we have is a new arms race, and there are a number of other things that we think the European Parliament simply has to speak out about.
I voted for the Manders report on regulations covering the labelling of textile products.

The Iranian opposition claims the programme has simply been dispersed over other sites but is still continuing.
Mr President, I wish, of course, to thank the three rapporteurs, and I will first of all turn to Mr Zwiefka and Mr Deprez.
In regard to freedom of thought, there is nothing worse than insisting that only one scientific opinion is correct and denouncing other ideas.
Agreement between the EC and Pakistan on certain aspects of air services (
Written declarations (Rule 142)
Secondly, inclusion in the draft directive of a provision on the introduction of intelligent metering and active control systems (smart metering) that aim to save energy.
The Russians even have a law that allows them to murder anyone - Russian citizen or foreign national - on foreign soil whom they deem to be a threat or a nuisance.
Well then, what have we proposed?
In view of the continual increase in imports from third countries, we must ensure that these imports also meet European standards.
That is why we decided to abstain from the vote on the joint motion for a resolution by the four political groups, including the PPE-DE Group, on European conscience and totalitarianism.
(SL) At our last sitting we adopted an important maritime legislation package which has improved procedures to be followed in the event of maritime accidents.
There must therefore be a guarantee that these toy parts can under no circumstances pose a threat to children.
(DE) Mr President, gender equality is a fundamental principle of the EU.
We may say we have heard it all.
An agreement has been rushed through which we ultimately welcome, but we cannot forget the Commission's excessive passivity when a modicum of prudent and forward-looking vision was needed.
This directive will significantly add to the cost of these funds and reduce returns, driving smaller funds out of business.
The Commission has already confirmed that it is dealing with Croatia and Turkey even-handedly.
The Hungarian Presidency is paying particular attention to ensuring that the European semester runs smoothly and successfully.
Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is not the solution to the problems but the cause.
Madam President, the first issue I want to discuss is that of our concerns about the functioning of the European agencies.
This legislative text has had - please forgive the expression - a difficult gestation period, mainly because attitudes still need to change a good deal in this area.
I think we would all agree that it is the duty of all democratically elected governments to investigate such findings fully in complete transparency, and to try and trace those whose bodies are there and their relatives, so that we can fully understand the situation and not apply various interpretations to it which might not be the truth.
Contrary to expectations, the financial crisis that started in America a year ago, far from abating, has hit the whole world again and again in ever bigger waves, including the financial markets and thus the economies of Europe.
Coordinated action is essential both at Member State level and between the various European institutions.
However, they also include products from cloned animals, the long-term consequences of which have barely been researched at present.
I am therefore thankful that, after the difficulties during the start-up phase of our new service, the External Action Service and the Commission are clearly now making progress and coming up with sensible proposals.
The decisions made by the European Union in this area are not replacing the measures already adopted by Member States, but are intended to support and supplement them.
I have voted in favour of the Mann report because the recommendation to change the way in which pensions are financed in the original report was not adopted by the European Parliament.
Commissioner, the budget for basic healthcare has not increased even proportionately since 2000 in the framework of the whole package of official development aid.
Therefore, I am pleased that the Council has agreed to EUR 0.2 million as a minimum contribution for each participating country, along with a single common evaluation mechanism and eligibility criteria, in the hope that this will increase coordination, transparency and credibility of the programme.
Mr President, please allow me to express my most sincere gratitude to all the Members who made a sustained effort on such a technical item.
The rapporteur favours an optional instrument.
Wednesday:
Furthermore, for the first time, this gives immigrants a legal means by which to enter European Union territory, in order to be able to work amongst us.
I merely have to get up - to rise from this seat - and the proceedings will be suspended automatically.
Here in the House, we voted by a large majority in favour of the inclusion of aviation in emissions trading.
However, it is also clear that Turkey presents a mixed picture and that much more needs to be done, not just to comply with the agreements with Europe, but also to fulfil promises to its own people.
Europe has reacted in a relatively swift and united manner, although there is an awareness, which is hopefully shared by all those who support nuclear technology, that radioactivity knows no national borders and that nature does not recognise safety standards, however high they may be set.
We cannot just talk about it; we also have to adopt legislative measures.
What consequences do you believe this failure could have for the transatlantic relationship, specifically at the level of sharing diplomatic and intelligence information?
Our task is to exercise parliamentary control, and so we cannot on any account impose self-censorship, which is open to abuse.
Subject: Lowering the price of SMSs sent or received in a different Member State (roaming)
I think that this is not the time for Europeans to give up in our engagement with Turkey.
I take the report on mutual recognition of judgments in absentia.
Two weeks ago, I was in Belgrade and, in meetings with education and training providers, I was once again assured of the importance of the agency.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is time for the European Commission to take its responsibilities seriously, to start investigating where and how fraud is being committed, and, potentially, to demand payment of any unpaid customs duties.
I am pleased, too, that the report we have voted through today has given attention to the importance of non-formal education, understood as education by participation in youth organisations and non-governmental organisations and by volunteering.
In this connection, we would, however, like to emphasise that the revenues from the trade in emissions allowances should accrue to the Member States.
I support the proposal for enhanced cooperation.
And yet here we are imposing another burden through this directive on local and regional authorities.
Moreover, in the event of an accident, passengers are entitled to assistance to cover their immediate practical needs, including, where necessary, provision of food and clothes, transport, facilitation of first assistance, and accommodation.
Firstly, we very much welcome the fact that the European Commission has included a proposal for a European Company Statute in its legislative programme for next year.
We reformed the Stability and Growth Pact in 2005.
The last EIT Council conclusions called for 'rapid additional action by the ESF to support employment, especially for the most vulnerable groups in the population, paying particular attention to the smallest undertakings by reducing non-wage labour costs'.
The comprehensive institution-building programme envisaged by the Eastern Partnership is a case in point, as it specifically targets institutions within the Ukrainian Government which need strengthening in order to deliver on reform.
We have raised the case repeatedly with the Afghan authorities, most recently with the Foreign Affairs Minister, Mr Spanta, at the troïka meeting in Ljubljana on 21 February.
President Trichet is better placed to testify on that than me because he was there then, but I would tend to agree, and that is why in our legislative package, which is now in your hands and in the hands of the Council, we want to supplement the strong monetary union by finally creating a genuine and strong economic union.
None of us exist in isolation. Only through coordinated action can we successfully overcome the effects of the global economic crisis.
Montenegro may in theory be splendidly 'green' and developing ideally, but Podgorica has to sustain this over the longer term.
It has revealed, for the third time, the need for a common energy policy.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Vice-President of the Commission. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to be able to inform the Members of the European Parliament that genuine progress has been made in harmonising mobile phone chargers in Europe.
Another important issue raised by the rapporteur is whether legal expenses insurance should be compulsory in all Member States.
Firstly, it is of an ethnic nature, since it was directed against the rebelling Ukrainian people, who had displayed their opposition to Russification on more than one occasion.
Mr President, I detect, particularly from the Commission, a tendency to present non-European Turkey in the best possible light.
Moreover, and importantly, I voted for the introduction of a mechanism to facilitate access to free legal aid, and for urgent psychological aid services to be provided free of charge for victims.
The EU must, as of now, set up and plan a proper response, including a detailed burden-sharing action plan to help refugees resettle in a coordinated manner.
He is also right to call for diversification of energy sources and supplies, for safer and more environmentally conscious energy production and for more efficient energy use.
(Applause from the left)
(FI) Mr President, we really have an excellent situation now.
It will be the European Commission, so I am not surprised that the Commission is a major backer.
Any attempt to reduce energy demand should not be allowed to run counter to the ambitions of the EU to maintain competitiveness and sustainable economic development.
All the amendments tabled were designed, first and foremost, to protect pedestrians and vulnerable road users.
However, the situation today is difficult.
In order to give people equal opportunities regarding access to information, work and so on, significant efforts are needed to introduce a barrier-free transport standard.
Is it the case that the media supervisory body in North Rhine-Westphalia will be used by the government for nine years?
They work as intimidation and will certainly be extremely traumatic for all those who want to defend human rights in Russia.
author. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Belarus is and remains the problem child in our Neighbourhood Policy.
A worker dismissed from Saab in Sweden enjoys social standards that are completely different to those of a worker dismissed from General Motors somewhere in Chicago and the governments in these two cases have completely different approaches, as the automatic stabilisers multiply the EUR 400 billion to something substantially higher and give us an undisputed advantage over the US in this regard.
Burma: continued detention of political prisoners (vote)
This tradition must be kept alive - the culture that is destroyed by nationalism and displacement, the culture of minorities, the regional culture, the culture of European regions that span borders and, in particular, the diversity that we will only be able to preserve together.
2.
The debate is closed.
They come from my sincere conviction that at last we have reports which show that European Neighbourhood Policy should, to a much greater extent, be based on values which, for us, are the most important: respect for human rights, freedom of the media and democratic governments.
Although I do not wish to appear too pessimistic, we run the risk that the Doha Round will merely result in our losing precious time.
We discussed this again yesterday with the President of the Commission.
(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, in principle I am against the introduction of new taxes.
There must also be clear consequences.
Mr Chairman, in conclusion I would like to bring up one technical issue.
That is why equal treatment between men and women is a horizontal policy in the Commission, conducted not just by the Commissioner responsible for this area, but also by other Commissioners in their own areas of responsibility, namely the areas concerning policies within the European Union as well as its external policies and, in particular, its cooperation and development policies.
Forest fires in Greece, their consequences and conclusions to be drawn for prevention and preparedness measures (debate)
That is why I think it is shameful that in Germany, of all countries, which will be hosting the Conference of the Parties, conservative-led Land governments such as Hesse and Lower Saxony have launched an initiative in the Bundesrat which constitutes an assault on this EU success story.
In particular, if it is to contribute effectively to the development of a single, competitive, energy market, the Agency needs more powers to tackle cross-border issues and encourage effective cooperation between transmission system operators (TSOs) and national regulatory authorities (NRAs).
The Community acquis of the free movement of capital is also called into question, as the so-called major countries are pushing for repatriation of their residents' capital.
Let us not forget that the Roma are European Union nationals; they too are EU citizens.
This means that prices rise and development becomes impossible.
Firstly, they are cheated in their home country, often handing over their life savings and more to ensure passage and work in the European Union.
This year, the Commission started to work together with national policy-makers, statistical offices, enforcement authorities and consumer organisations to further develop the Scoreboard indicators, and we will continue with this cooperation in the coming years.
I urge all my colleagues to support this amendment.
There have been some encouraging developments at times, but these are also accompanied by some very repressive judgments.
While condemning the 'violence' perpetrated by the PKK and 'other terrorist groups', it merely advises the Turkish army not to engage in any 'disproportionate military operations'.
However, since the deed has been done, we would have liked the vote to have been conducted in circumstances which complied fully with the standard procedure.
Compared to either of the other institutions, Parliament can still be considered to lead the way when it comes to transparency and so I would not make it my top priority, since with regard to both the accessibility of documents and to the transparency of its sittings and the activities of the Members of the European Parliament, we are more open than any national parliament.
We Europeans have to be more active.
in writing. - I voted for this proposal which lays down rules regarding imports into the EU from Greenland of fishery products and other marine products.
One final request is to involve this sector in social dialogue.
This is essential to resolving this situation.
After all, it is as clear as day that Turkey does not meet the conditions for accession to the EU, and that this will still be the case in 10, 15 or 20 years time.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, as this is a joint debate and with the agreement of the Chair, I would like to address both the agricultural implications of an association agreement with Mercosur and the forthcoming Summit at the beginning of the session.
I would like to help ensure that there is a majority in favour of this plan within the necessary deadline.
The protection of ordinary consumers of financial services will receive special attention.
Statute of the European Ombudsman (
The detection of explosives in liquids seems now to be well on the way.
Do they think for one moment that the rest of the European Union would accept that one single Member State opts out of the obligations that we have jointly developed at European level to govern our market?
The fact that, to achieve excellence, policy is an activity in which it is necessary to predict and take measures assumes a particular relevance when the issues in question are matters which are so essential to our common lives, such as foreign and security policy.
Member of the Commission. - As I said at the beginning of my speech, one of the best tools for fighting child pornography and child sex abuse is the swift adoption of the Commission proposal of March 2010, the one against child sex abuse.
How does the proposal appear in the context of the development cooperation policies?
This progress includes the recent adoption by the Council of the framework decision on racism and xenophobia and the adoption of the framework decision on the protection of data in the third pillar, even if this is regarded merely as a first step.
A draft agreement was initialled with Morocco at the Euro-Mediterranean Trade Ministerial conference in Brussels on 9 December 2009, and confirmed during the EU-Morocco Summit on 7 March 2010.
However, it is important to say clearly to this House that, in terms of privacy protection, the signed ad referendum agreement that we are debating here today is a great improvement on the protocols in place prior to this agreement.
Another objective is the legal protection of farmers.
However, we have enough time to answer the next two questions.
For now, I think the most pressing question is how we as the European Union can work together to deliver a strong and coherent message to the Chinese authorities and to the Tibetan demonstrators: a message which will help bring the violence to an end and the two sides together in a really substantive dialogue.
I myself spoke about the need for Europe to keep its commitments so that we could be credible.
I would like to stress that it will not bring major changes or anything new in terms of the basic premises on which European security and defence policies are founded.
Action taken on Parliament's resolutions: see Minutes
No one knows the true effect this is having on our health.
One real problem lies with application of the rules by public buyers.
I would like to take this opportunity to put a couple of questions that I have concerning the commitments made by the Commission in connection with the negotiations ahead of the first reading vote on the Toys Directive, as well as ahead of our plenary vote.
We need to have a modern effective social agenda.
However, the rapporteur engages in detailed propaganda in favour of the European Parliament having a greater role in relations between Africa and the EU.
I believe that last statement contained elements which were very close to being defamatory of a government of the European Union.
The Commission remains committed to the accession process with Turkey.
Thanks to its adoption by practically all Member States, the directive which is currently in force was, undoubtedly, the first step in the direction of administrative cooperation in this field, although it was evident that specific results were lacking in terms of its implementation.
I regret to say that we have also found that it is being used when perhaps it has been decided not to execute an arrest warrant because there is evidence to show that it was unjustly issued and this is then not respected by the issuing Member State - resulting in the unfortunate situation in which the citizens concerned are repeatedly arrested whenever they cross a border.
Thank you, Parliament.
Trade is not in itself a threat to the environment - on the contrary.
(NL) You have quite rightly pointed out, Mr President, Commissioner, that human rights have never been a purely domestic issue.
What I can tell you is the following: we need a President of the Council who is a committed European and who gives consistency all the time, because I do not think it proper to have a Council that changes its agenda completely every six months.
In my view, the compromise agreed by the Member States will not result in transparent regulation in this area, given that Member States can also apply three different separation models.
I therefore welcome all cultural programmes whose objective is to create a European identity from shared values and mutual understanding.
They need to be subjected to rigorous stress testing and all financial activities need to remain on the balance sheet.
Nothing is new under the sun.
The constant violation of working times is probably the rule rather than the exception.
Nonetheless, the situation and ongoing developments in North Africa mean that we are called on once again to produce results in double-quick time.
For 15 years the EU has been tightening control of the export of dual-use goods, relying on preventive measures such as the imposition of export licensing requirements and customs registration procedures.
I will, today, find a solution to this for the future.
I think there are no longer sufficient reasons to retain the system of sanctions in dealings with Belarus.
As soon as news of the earthquake broke, ECHO's emergency response system was mobilised.
This is an issue that you yourself mentioned, Mr President.
High-quality regional data is necessary for the purpose of identifying regions that qualify for EU assistance, as well as for assessing progress in regional cohesion policy.
(SV) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, on the morning of Sunday 23 September 2001, the Swedish citizen Dawit Isaak was taken from his home in Eritrea by the country's authorities.
We must also fight stereotyping, as highlighted here today, and we must ensure that the organisation of working hours, working time and jobs better responds to women's rights, and also to the right to maternity and paternity which are recognised as fundamental social values of the European Union.
Nuclear power, as an emission-free form of energy, should not raise the target for renewable energy.
Thank you.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to refer back to a passage of Commissioner De Gucht's speech on international development cooperation.
In particular, I am keen to inform the European Parliament regularly about the latest developments regarding negotiations on the Framework Agreement.
At the same time, it is necessary to continue to reflect on the most effective ways to transpose measures introduced by regional fisheries management organisations into EU law.
We respect the decision of the Member States to enter into the European Pact for Mental Health and Well-being referred to in the report.
Some changes are already yielding visible benefits in areas such as the agricultural budget.
We saw similar scenes in my home country, the United Kingdom, last year when Excel Airways went bankrupt, leaving over 200 000 people out of pocket, without compensation and stranded at a whole host of airports throughout Europe, with it costing them even more money to find accommodation and flights home.
I hope that this method of determining the quality of a society is given high priority and that sufficient resources are earmarked to enable it to work properly and not to simply remain an unimplemented idea.
There are lessons to be learned, and we are learning these lessons, and we will push forward with many plans and measures to create more streamlined air traffic management in Europe.
The aims of the directive are clear, and my group is happy to support them in principle.
President of the Commission. - Thank you very much, Mr Kamiński.
With regard to climate change, my wish is that the Union will speak with one voice and act jointly after Copenhagen, no matter what the scope of the outcome of the conference.
Unfortunately, there is also a drawback to this accomplishment, however, which is that these marriages often end in separation, and then there is the issue of the necessary divorce.
I think it was right to reject proposals for the introduction of a pan-European energy or coal tax, which would only lead to increased energy costs and would hit low-income groups the hardest.
Apart from the style, we will remember above all the mode of governance of the European Union that he initiated, in particular the irruption of politics into a world where it traditionally had no place, something that I have always called for.
Warnings on bottles are effective, as studies in the USA have already shown.
It is advisable, in fact, to create a more flexible rule than that suggested by the Commission.
In other words, there is no signature either from the minister for finance or the prime minister.
in writing. - Transparency of political institutions is a prerequisite for legitimacy.
That is why I see the strengthening of this instrument and the Union's greater commitment to development cooperation as important.
Our resolution, however, proposes, among other things, 'provision of comprehensive and safe abortion' and regrets the lack of provision of services in the field of reproductive health.
There should be no intervention, subsidiarity should be respected, and specific national commitments are required with regard to special groups, young people, people with disabilities and people with multiple disadvantages.
As you know, the Commission has now launched an initiative, namely the innovative partnerships.
We hope that the Member States will stop supporting mining projects using cyanide-based technologies.
This intervention was absolutely necessary two weeks ago because the European Union had taken a wishy-washy attitude.
In the opinion of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, democracy and the role of Parliament are being undermined.
We must never forget the important role women play in resolving conflicts or the need to establish communication that is based on trust between the forces of international institutions and local populations.
Countless firms have relocated to take advantage of the lower labour costs found in China and India, for example, with dire consequences for the entire national economy.
Ladies and gentlemen, the situation prevailing in the Middle East also takes us back to the need to accept our responsibilities at international level.
Yes, that is correct.
As I have said, this is a very fluid situation and we have to read it very carefully.
I would draw the attention of the people who said that the Bank should not have involvements outside the Union to the fact that the European Union has an external policy and the European Investment Bank might be helpful in achieving its goals.
We need to do better: yes to a responsible common immigration policy but no to a restrictive and discriminatory one!
(DE) Commissioner, you were right to draw attention to the problem and to the fact that the main reason it cannot be resolved is that because of the unanimity principle Member States are not budging.
The European citizens' initiative (ECI) is an instrument of public participation that aims to respond to the democratic deficit and, as such, to reduce the distance that European citizens feel exists between them and European institutions.
Written declarations (Rule 142)
However, the Court of Auditors revealed errors and anomalies in the evaluation of one open procurement procedure which affected its quality.
It also brings into play the importance of having a European agency such as the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) to monitor, collaborate and inform the Member States.
I voted to strengthen the OSCE, which must be based on harmony between the three main pillars that the organisation is founded on: political and military, economic and environmental, and human.
But what this agreement does not remove, indeed it reinforces them, are the many reasons to be critical of this budget that we have left out here.
In terms of our borders with third countries, the FRONTEX agency's work should include measures to tackle human trafficking.
The chief goal of the Eastern Partnership, which is concerned with six of our neighbouring countries, is to help those countries who want to come much more into line with the European Union on certain key issues like standards of governments, freer trade and others.
New types of ICT can make life easier for persons of an advanced age, and help them to remain active at work and in their private lives.
This unit must cooperate effectively with the police authorities in Member States and in third countries, with the relevant expertise.
It is important to listen to people's views, but it is also important to learn from experience.
Domestic violence is the greatest social scourge of our time, not only in Europe but worldwide.
The ambitious Europe 2020 programme was adopted unanimously last July by the European Council.
- (EL) Mr President, our greatest concern regarding the proposals for a solution for Kosovo relates to the attempt to place a unilateral declaration of independence on a legal footing, and this would have momentous consequences for international law.
We should pay special attention to the continual need to raise the competence of foreign-language teachers and to introduce new teaching methods.
The honourable Members Mr Virrankoski and Mr Itälä have dealt with the budgetary matters very competently.
Following the Paris Declaration on 13 July 2008, which created a new Union for the Mediterranean (UfM), the previous Barcelona Process should have acknowledged a new impetus, as expressed in the Declaration: 'a renewal of efforts to transform the Mediterranean region into a space of peace, democracy, cooperation and prosperity'.
However, the mixed fisheries problem exists and, if we do not address it, there can be no improvements and no steps can be taken in the right direction.
Comprehensive air agreements with neighbouring countries or significant global partners can deliver substantial benefits to passengers, freight operators and airlines, by means of both market access and regulatory convergence to promote fair competition, including issues with regard to state subsidies and social and environmental standards.
The Council has worked continually and very actively on her behalf.
All of them gave very specific examples of measures they are taking in this area.
The Irish Government will defend its position because it acted only after independent reports from the Director of the National Museum of Ireland were given to the Irish Government.
I know that they will now welcome today's vote in bringing these proposals into legislation.
The modulation process must be applied in moderation.
Furthermore, it is also important to monitor those European investments in third countries which have a major impact on the EU energy market.
I attach great importance to the expertise and information that we derive from our exchange of experience and dialogue about possible solutions with citizens, interest groups, lawyers and lobbyists.
We will therefore pursue our principled course of critical, but also constructive, engagement with our neighbour, confident that Russia, too, knows its interests lie in maintaining a real strategic partnership with us.
There are still problems as regards minorities and unprotected groups as well.
I would say to the Commissioner that, if I were in her place, I would make every effort to assist in training the thinking democratic elite.
For a country in which human rights and democracy, environmental protection and sustainability currently continue to have such little importance, this approach is probably not totally illogical either.
We know that these are rules that will be used as a framework and as an unquestionable and unassailable point of reference.
The fight against terrorism is once again being used as an excuse to provide for restrictive measures and sanctions against governments of third states, natural or legal persons, groups or non-state entities.
Let me reply, however, to some of the comments that have been made here.
Written statements (Rule 149)
There are two such filling stations in France, for example, and one in Spain, while there are none at all in the new Member States that joined the European Union in 2004 and 2007.
That makes it necessary immediately to put forward proposals to control greenhouse gas emissions which are more equitable and more widely accepted than those of the Kyoto protocol based on the principle of 'grandfathering', i.e. 'whoever has polluted most, can continue to pollute most'.
I think there is a need to consolidate the financial situation and to devise measures to promote growth.
This is very painful for me, as Ukraine is am important neighbour and strategic partner for us.
In this regard, I believe that the EU-Canada Summit in Brussels on 5 May 2010 offers a good opportunity to speed up those negotiations.
For this reason, I sent a letter to Prime Minister Berisha one week before the January demonstrations, in which I set out a road map based on these 12 priorities, to help Albania emerge from the current impasse.
The Union has extended a helping hand to Belarus in the form of inclusion in the Eastern Partnership, a programme which is intended to strengthen democracy and the rule of law.
There are just two concerns I would like to raise today.
The requisite authorisation was obtained from the competent quaestor, Mr Fazakas, before the poster went on display.
I voted in favour of the report by Mrs Krehl because it highlights best practices in several areas, including in the area of the environment and sustainable energy.
That is another reason why the summit was a success.
Nevertheless, everything is subordinated to this religion, as can be seen by reading this report on international trade.
Finally, I should like to emphasise the importance of the EGF, which has been shown to be a useful and effective resource for combating unemployment resulting from globalisation and the economic crisis.
I also urge my fellow Members to do so to ensure that we are not left behind in such matters.
I recognise and respect the fact that there are still some difficulties for some political groups and, indeed, some delegations, and so there are still a number of amendments to be decided in plenary later this morning.
(Applause)
For this reason it is important to have impartial environmental reports produced, so that the risks may be established and weighed up against the benefits.
In fact, this is not just my position but the unanimous position of the Commission.
Everyone shares the view that the rules are good.
Similarly, employers should be encouraged to invest in people with experience of life.
As I have said, the Almadén district could obviously be considered for safe storage of mercury, provided it meets the conditions to be imposed, and provided it has the necessary permits.
It is to be hoped that Ukraine will manage to overcome the protracted political crisis and that the Ukrainian Government will in future be involved in EU talks that, on the basis of mutual interest, will make it possible to establish close cooperation.
Agriculture cannot, therefore, be compared with other sectors of the economy which are able to thrive in a free market, because the food market is not a free market.
Things must become clearer, with fewer, but improved regulations.
The weakness of Ukraine's constitutional framework has also contributed to this.
(ES) Mr President, Mr Wathelet, Mr Barroso, Commissioner Lewandowski, ladies and gentlemen, my political group wants a normal budget for 2011.
Finally, I should like to underline the importance of the new Europe 2020 Strategy for growth and employment, which plays an important role in getting us out of the crisis.
Sometimes 'profiling' can be necessary, but such cases must be clearly delineated and protected against abuse.
I think that, on this point too, we could take matters further after the debate.
Setting up a cooperation arrangement along these lines is the aim behind this initiative.
How much time does France need to reform pensions?
Apart from sanctions, there was also a result.
In this report, the Commission shall reflect developments in the medium-term economic position, in particular, potential growth, prevailing cyclical conditions, the implementation of policies in the context of the Lisbon Agenda and policies to foster research and development and innovation.
He has made it clear that in times such as these, public finances must make a special effort to adopt measures aimed at economic revival and social protection so as to mitigate the effects of the crisis.
The decision on how well or badly the international agreements specified in the annex to the current regulation are actually implemented and whether preferences should be abandoned if necessary should therefore be tested extremely carefully.
The tragic month of July 1995, when Serb troops led by Ratko Mladić massacred over 8 000 Bosniaks, still lives in all our hearts.
The situation is similar when we look at civil liberties, including religious freedom.
However, likewise it is incorrect that the world has stayed silent for so long; we can no longer remain silent.
We support the European Agency for Development in Special Needs Education.
This action has been criticised for 'not showing much credibility' or for being a 'typical display of German angst'.
Due to the events of the past summer - here I refer to the Russo-Georgian conflict - our eastern neighbours in my opinion justifiably expect a greater contribution from the EU to the safeguarding of stability.
in writing. - I voted in favour of the resolution, and strongly support calls to prevent media monopolies operating in Europe.
However, a change in this system does not give the EU a direct right of taxation, as the Treaty does not provide for any such competence for the Union.
All victims deserve respect and expect that the perpetrators of their suffering will be punished fairly.
We also need to find the right balance between the political priority attached to this system and, at the same time, the guarantee of excellence of the service rendered to the national authorities that will use it.
In addition, Member States will provide national diplomats with a guarantee of immediate reinstatement after their service in the European External Action Service.
It is a reason for taking on those importers and exporters who commit fraud.
in writing. - Our seas are our common resource.
Nevertheless, the framework decision adopted in 2006 was something of a compromise, establishing the lowest common denominator in the protection of personal data.
It will cover the European Parliament's report and the assessment that will have been carried out by the agency in accordance with Article 33 of the Frontex regulation.
Today however, while my colleagues and I voted clearly for a reduction in pesticides in our day-to-day lives, it is important that we acknowledge the practical reality of the needs of farmers and fruitgrowers, particularly in this climate of rising food prices.
The new regulation will not do away with this dependency at a stroke, but nonetheless it will create more transparent relations.
Like all colleagues, I am, of course, in favour of intergovernmental cooperation in police, intelligence and security matters, particularly when we face growing problems from international organised crime, international terrorism etc.
Food price rises have hit the most vulnerable sections of the population hardest.

Member of the Commission. - Mr President, several questions have been asked on Sri Lanka and on Colombia, and on why, in one case, we decided to have an enquiry and take a decision and in the other case we did not.

The questions with which we started this review will still be present in six months, in a year and in two years, and I firmly believe that, in due course, they are going to have to be addressed.

What we need are legal immigrant workers with rights and obligations, not slaves.

We have good arguments that we can bring up repeatedly to ensure that food security is guaranteed in Europe in future.
(SK) More than half of the population of Europe is overweight.
The Chinese Communist Party can rejoice, since it must have achieved a lot of success for the legitimisation of power.
Although I support the compromise we have now reached, I have made a point of mentioning the shortcomings of the process and the outcome, both in the interests of honesty and to highlight - as I have done on previous occasions - the ludicrous situation where governments across the globe are producing multiple billions of dollars to bail out banks but have to search their souls to find, between 27 Member States and the budget of this Union, EUR 1 billion for the poorest people in the world.

I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.

Do we want to casually enter into a conflict with China now to obtain raw materials as quickly as possible, or do we want to still be able to benefit from Africa's prosperity at a later date?

Pursuing these objectives with the real involvement of civil society means proceeding doggedly along the path to achieving the Millennium Development Goals and placing the eradication of hunger and all forms of poverty above all other goals.

But, while welcoming these agreements, I nevertheless share with the rapporteur a number of concerns.

Violence has never, as I said before, achieved long-lasting results.
I would not go so far as to echo Mr Schulz in calling this a marginal problem - 27 000 Tunisians do not constitute a marginal problem - but he is right to say that, by comparison with, for example, the 350 000 people who fled from Kosovo during the Kosovo war, we are clearly not talking about a migration tsunami.
In many discussions, whether multilateral or bilateral, I tell people that they should start their preparatory work for the next round of funding applications now by considering which projects can be implemented on a joint basis and what financial resources these might require.

Although I have been in this business for a long time, I learnt something new by being involved in this.
Is it because cohesion policy has nothing to say in response to competition policy, which allows a new Member State to entice away Dell, a keystone industry in the area, with EUR 54 million in state aid?

We must invest in these countries' independence and cut the ground away from nationalism.
There is the deception of consumers who, having used a mobile telephone such as this one, which their contract told them included international calls, have a shock when they discover the cost of their bills.
I must also congratulate the rapporteur on having set firm deadlines for the publication of decisions.
The codecision procedure will spread to almost all European policies, and the role of Parliament in democratic supervision, the creation of international agreements and the appointment of the top European representatives will be strengthened.

(IT) As the statements by the government representatives of numerous States demonstrate, the extraordinary zeal with which Julian Assange is being investigated is clearly designed to punish him and WikiLeaks for having revealed certain top secrets to the world, such as the concerns of the US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, who asked the US embassies in Rome and Moscow for information on any personal investments of Mr Berlusconi and Mr Putin that might influence the foreign or economic policies of their respective countries.
